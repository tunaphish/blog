# Be an amateur
TODO: not very thought through
often times when you start something there's a huge divide between your taste and your ability to create. overcome it and just be an amateur. someone in love with the craft and wear it proudly and [[allow-yourself-to-be-vulnerable]]

> if you spend your life avoiding vulnerability then your work will never truly connect with anyone
