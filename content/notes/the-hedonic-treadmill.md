title: The Hedonic Treadmill
---
Humans live their life through an illusion. This is due to evolutionary biology shaping our minds not to see reality as it is but as a means to propogate our genes to the next generation. This means you cannot always trust things as you see them. 

# An Everyday Example
This most often takes the form of 'sensory' pleasures such as junk food, promotion seeking etc. These wants motivated by the fact that:
1. Our perception of satisfaction from attaining whatever pleasure is over inflated
2. The pleasure leaves relatively quickly
3. Forces us to want the next thing 

This is pretty similar to the progression of porn habits and the need for increasingly deviant behavior.

# counterpoint
things are temporal and that's fine. a powdered donut gives you fleeting happiness. but a lifetime appreciation of sweets isn't a bad thing either. living my life trying new desserts, comparing and contrasting, trying to bake them myself and sharing them with others. there is a lifetime of joy, happiness and contentness with it. 

maybe it's not just about the object, [[your-work-does-not-speak-for-itself]] and everything surrounding it. Developing a connoisseur's pallette, [[the-importance-of-family-meals]].
