title: Eji

# appearance
- gold chains

name doesn't have a whole lot of thought put into it. It's vaguely asian (japanese) sounding and sounds like edgy. 

eji was a politician? too young for that... an aspiring one? someone who can influence at the very least. popular? wanted to change the world.
eji's got an ottermode build. fairly lanky.

eji struggles to control how he feels. this reflects in his mental battles. they don't build up and unleash like it does for sei. he attempts to inhibit them. bottle them up. breathing exercises. but it doesn't work. it leaks out. his interpretation of control.

sei informs him that he needs to let emotions out. let them flow and feel them fully. only then can he control them. 

# eji and sei
eji and [[sei]]'s story is a personal one. a story about regret.

sei likes traditional first wave diner bitter coffee. eji has him try new third wave coffee. visibly makes a face "it's sour". it's not bad. it's just not coffee. 

eji and sei are both hardworkers. eji is more callous though. youthful. brash. headstrong. he's like the sun. a big theme is their bond together.
