title: always eventually right 
---
The most misunderstood Amazon leadership principle is "is usually right." At first glance this is the surface level meaning. That they are always right. They come into meetings trying to convince everyone of their way of thinking. Always pushing back. Forcing others to submit by sheer will instead of working together to form a shared vision. 

My interpretation is the saying should be are eventually right. Good leaders arrive at the right answer, maybe not right away but with time. This manifests by meeting everyone's needs. Making little bets (small iteration cycles). Keeping doors open until they truly need to close them. 

But maybe that's not good enough. Maybe you need to be right, and right right now. [[compounding-interest]] dictates that decisions made today are worth more then decisions made later. That means people who get it right the first time are inherently more valuable then the people who eventually make the right decision.
