## fear of failure
the antithesis to what I believe to be my biggest issue in life. I'm afraid of expressing my authentic self because I believe I won't be accepted. I cover it up with analysis paralysis to delay putting my work out there. Sarcasm to avoid expressing my true beliefs. Weasel words to avoid having an opinion. 

## no guilty pleasures
you like it for a reason. oftentimes the worth of something is determined arbitrarily. beauty is in the eye of the beholder and often times it just takes the right narrative  to highlight something's beauty.

## sarcasm and cynicism
referred to as the lowest form of humor because it mocks one's attempt to be vulnerable while offering nothing in return. avoid this type of humor.

## have your beliefs challenged
I remember a chat with Tucker Penney where he talked about how everyone should express their beliefs. The primary function of this was to have your beliefs challenged. 
You can go your whole life without having your beliefs challenged and be worse off for it.
