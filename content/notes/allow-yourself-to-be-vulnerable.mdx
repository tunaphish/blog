# fear of failure
the antithesis to what I believe to be my biggest issue in life. I'm afraid of expressing my authentic self because I believe I won't be accepted. I cover it up with analysis paralysis to delay putting my work out there. Sarcasm to avoid expressing my true beliefs. Weasel words to avoid having an opinion. 

# imposter syndrome
Imposter syndrome happens for me quite often on things that are fairly open in the public mind. Things like food taste or video skills. In contrast with software engineering where I feel I have a pretty firm grasp on things and it doesn't really exist to the public, I don't have the irrational thought that someone will call me out for my lack of knowledge.

But with things like filmmaking or art where everyone has an opinion on those things, it feels a lot harder to put myself out there. 

# no guilty pleasures
you like it for a reason. oftentimes the worth of something is determined arbitrarily. beauty is in the eye of the beholder and often times it just takes the right narrative  to highlight something's beauty.

# sarcasm and cynicism
referred to as the lowest form of humor because it mocks one's attempt to be vulnerable while offering nothing in return. avoid this type of humor.

# have your beliefs challenged
I remember a chat with Tucker Penney where he talked about how everyone should express their beliefs. The primary function of this was to have your beliefs challenged. You can go your whole life without having your beliefs challenged and be worse off for it. 

# "no homo"
men latched onto "acting homo" with their buddies because it's one of the only ways to display genuine affection for your friends without sacrificing traditional masculinity. let go of this. compliment others. allow yourself to be complimented
