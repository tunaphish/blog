title: Emotions as an Affect Heurstic
---
Remember that [[decision-making-length-should-be-proportional-to-importance]]
emotions support this principal by helping you quickly make decisions. Does this person piss you off? Don't hire them. A situation feels scary? Get out of there. Intuitives hone this ability and are able to progress far in life with "gut feeling" decision making. 

# creating art
this is important because people's hearts are changed by emotion. not by logic. you don't win people with facts. you win them with feelings

A lot of chefs learned how to cook by brute force. Simply experimenting with different things until they discovered what tasted good guided by their intuition. This brute force nature reminds of [[interview-loop-habit-chain]] which isn't always the wrong answer. 

Similar to intuitive vs logical leaders 

# fiction's ability to change the world vs non thinking   
Everything is to change thinking. Oftentimes art is better at this because it appeals to pathos and itâ€™s entertaining.

This is another way that fiction tends to be greater than non fiction. Is the breadth that it can reach. Although I've argued you should favor depth over breadth many times, it's undeniable that you reach far more people with your philsophical thoughts in a game like Nier Automata vs Thus Spoke Zarathustra. 

Is that actually true though? Nier Automata will stay in the public conscious for maybe a decade but once it's no longer supported it's difficult, the graphics get too bad then the amount of people will generally stop playing it. This is somewhat difficult to judge because video games are a medium in their infancy vs the rich history of written text.
