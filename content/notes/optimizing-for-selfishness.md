title: Optimizing for Selfishness

# selfishness rises to the top
When you get to the higher echelons in the world then everyone around you is an exceptional person. Generally, they are smart, capable, charismatic individuals for them to have made it this far. At that point, there's one pillar left to ascend and that is your willingness to hurt others for personal gain. That is the last one and why evil inviduals always ascend to the top. 

# capitalism
Capitalism assumes most efficient means of production is driven by human selfishness. That innovation is driven by that. There's two issues I have with that.
One, is that even true? And if it is, is it desirable?

Capitalism promotes inequalilty. Inequality stifles innovation when individuals aren't able to do what it is they want to do. When individuals aren't able to capitalize on their ideas through lack of time or capitol. 

If capitalism is meant to game selfishness that means the most selfish individuals will be the most successful. This is rewarded with influence. Should the the most selfish individuals be given the most money, influence and power in the world?

Is this even desirable from a biological perspective? Truly we are meant to propogate our genes. To spread humanity. In the short term, capitalism makes sense and human kind has gained the dominant power on earth. But it's come at the long term health of Earth and because of the mass inequality it doesn't effeciently propogate the benefits to other parts of the world. It seems like the goal for most billionaires is to propogate humanity beyond earth. But Earth can conceivably stick around for billions of years before the death of the sun forces humanity to leave. Climate change seems like it is a larger forcing function.
