title: Discords are True Community Hubs
--- 

Discords are true community hubs vs social media which most people perceive as the defacto online communication tool . This is because there's no likes or social capitol to accumulate other then your direct relationships with others. There's no ads gaming you. things are inherently temporal. 

[[participate-in-communities]] says to actually engage in quality NOT quantity relationships with others. This is exactly what Discord does. 

## my history with community hubs on the internet 
it all started with the halo days on those custom servers. I still think that was the epitome because it was so easy to create commmunities by hosting your own servers. people naturally congregated around the same servers and you actually got to know people and join clans. with a game as baseline as halo you even saw people develop playstyles. I remember bigzilla constantly grabbing the sniper, sticky rice doing some sneaky shit and myself gravitating to the banshee. those days were so much fun lol. the custom servers where you'd play zombies. playing with my brother and kevin. they still play together to this day in discords. that was probably the natural evolution of online gaming communities after after years of ranked online play.
