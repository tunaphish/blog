Women have their pick of men. They want a good man. Biological instinct for men is to be with multiple women. Vs women to lock down one good man. 

That's the explanation given by incels about the large sex disparity in men. There's a few high quality men who make up the bulk of sexual partners for women whereas all the rest of the men just don't have sex. 

# the friendship paradox
This is similar to the friendship paradox about why it seems like all your friends have more friends then you but all your friends friends also have more friends then them. It's because there's a few individuals with a crazy high amount of friends who are friends with all your friends. 

# counterpoint
The argument against this is that it's a nice idea in theory but lots and lots of nuance and other competing factors and theories in the world don't make this a reality. [[strive-for-ideals-operate-practically]] put in another way (although I wouldn't say this is something to strive for). It just explains why while it sounds like a good theory it doesn't exactly play out that way in real life.
