> the action or practice of publicly expressing opinions or sentiments intended to demonstrate one's good character or the moral correctness of one's position on a particular issue

Kind of like peacocking. Projecting an image of yourself to the extent that it overshadows who you actually are. This isn't just selling yourself. It's aggrandizing yourself. 

# Relation to the Internet
the desire to show that you are a good person rather than actually just being a good person. exacerbated by the internet because your internet personality is just your thoughts and expressions... that's it. The internet is inexpicably intertwined with people's identities because of this. And the fact that it's shared with the entire world means that inherently scales and overshadows your actual self. 

I wonder if this is inherently understood by people's unconscious but not conscious why is why it seems like trolls manifest on the internet. I struggle to think that anonymity is the only reason for this. Even seemingly normal people will pop off in comments on Instagram or Tiktok with no regard. 

# Thoughts Vs Actions
am I good person deep down? 
there is no deep down. you are what you do. 
the road to hell is paved with good intentions. 
discussed in atomic habits as well. you are what you do. what's that quote. 

# Myself, My inferiority/superiority complex paradox
this aligns with my superiority/inferiority complex paradox. I judge others by their actions whereas I judge myself by my potential. My surface level thoughts give me a superiority complex but in my core I know that isn't true and that it's your actions are what matter which is why I still have an inferiority complex. I haven't done anything.
