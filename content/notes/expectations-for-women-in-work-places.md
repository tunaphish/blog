title: expectations for women in work places
---
setting and meeting expectations is incredibly important. in the world of work that manifests itself as the tenet of **underestimate, overdeliver**. A boss would rather the employee who estimates average output and delivers outputs instead of the employee who estimates perfect output and delivers great output. the second employee performed more but did not meet expectations. this is where biases hurt women in the workplace.

 Because the perceived bias for women is to be likeable, warm, and friendly; women make a likability trade off more then men. this manifests itself as women being forced to couch opinions when the same opinion can be vouched by men more aggressively and with more confidence.
