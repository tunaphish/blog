---
people express and receive love differently. identify how your loved ones communicate their love languages

1. acts of service
2. quality time
3. gifts
4. touch
5. words of affirmation




mom's been cooking a lot. that's her preferred way of expressing love languages which is acts of service. how does she receive love? in lots of ways lol. she seems to like gifts, chatting, words of affirmation and quality time. hugs and kisses so touch. similar to others in that way...
