title: During Crisis the Vulnerable are Hit Harder
---
This sounds obvious but I don't see it really mentioned all that often. When a disaster hits there's a blanket of misfortune and everyone is worse off then they originally were. But it doesn't apply equally. During COVID it even manifested itself as a K shape recovery. This observation is that people who were already in good positions in life did even better. Their jobs turned remote. They had space to quarantine, resources to move around. Whereas the poor suffered even worse who didn't have those things. It's what happened with our interns during the CQ project.
