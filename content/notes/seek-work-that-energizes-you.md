# Jeff Bezo's Work Life Harmony
This contrasts with work life balance that concludes energy to be a zero sum game. The more you invest in work then less you invest in life. Instead work life harmony touts that you should strive for a life where your work gives you energy and your life gives you energy. They feed into eachother supplying each side with energy and forming the virtuous cycle. 

# Energy vampires
There are people in life that add energy in the room. And there are people in life who take it away. Strive to be like the first example. 

# As opposed to focusing on impact
Impact is a company centric approach whereas energy is a person centric approach. This aligns with the idea that you should better yourself and that inevitably makes the company better. Also aligns with the idea of scaling down focus.
