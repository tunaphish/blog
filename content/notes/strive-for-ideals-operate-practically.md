title: Strive for Ideals, Operate Practically
---

There's a huge gap between how society should operate and what it currently is. This is going to be true at any stage of development. 

Philosophy, generallities should be discussed in a vacuum. Can strive for perfection. But when you attempt to apply these ideals to reall life, context is required and sometimes an ideal cannot be reached. It needs to be balanced with time as a resource. What we can do now to push us towards that ideal but address all the issues at hand. 

# inviduals over trends
Another flavor of idealism vs realism. 

When it comes to mental differences. Individuality varies so much that using sex or race as any kind of indicator makes no sense. But does it make sense when speaking in generalities and trends. Thatâ€™s the argument the google manifesto guy was talking about. Cultural factors effect these things. The meme stat about black crime is often brought up outside of the context of increased policing in minority neighborhoods or the correlation between being poor and committing crime. But once we do away with those factors if there was just a difference in mental biology that pre determines behavior in certain ways that only manifests itself as trends and generalities. Do you police against that. I believe that is what the Google Manifesto guy was getting at in his paper. Idealogically it might make sense. But again there's so much in life, so much nuance that it really doesn't play out like that and using a single mental model to enforce your thinking is folly.
