title: Inertia of Traditions
---

The result of arbitrary decisions perpetuating over time by virtue of having persisting over time rather then whatever they were meant to decide in the first place. 

Time changes things. Changes context. Meaning traditions that once made sense, may not make sense anymore. Understand and appreciate where these things came from, but seperate yourself from it and evaluate them for what they are.
