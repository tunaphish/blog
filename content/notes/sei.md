title: sei
---

sei is measured, composed. relaxed. flexibile. 

wears a necklace with a simple chain and an ornate pendant. 
sei's necklace pendant (a signature piece) becomes a dangly earring that eji wears after their battle. 

sei doesn't have a scythe (or equivilent weapon). you don't need it. 

sei's backstory is a lost love. he lived a good life. stoic mindset. they both died together. (or he died first and she found a new love) he waited for her but she never showed up. he waited for a long time. eventually he naturally forgot why he felt the way he did. one day someone offered him a coat and a job. he's someone who takes his responsibilities seriously. does the adult job. his story is that sometimes it doesn't matter. sometimes you'll just die full of regret. 

Sei is a reluctant mentor.
