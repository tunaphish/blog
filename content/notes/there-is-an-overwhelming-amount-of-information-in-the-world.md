This has resulted in an overflow of knowlege, more than anyone can hope to contain in a lifetime.
This has a few implications.

1. The first is the creation of the [[attention-economy]] and how that becomes your most important resource. Social media's goal is to drain that resource from you, that's their currency. 
2. the next avenue for the progression of knowledge is filtering out what's relevant, true (fake news) and how we experience that knowledge (Oculus, virtual reality). curating your input streams becomes incredibly important so you can [[favor-depth-of-experience-over-breadth]]. Biasing towards long form media is helpful because it implicitly filters out vapid, low thoughts that and common with low barriers of entry for sharing information online. The skill in your mind to forget things is called active inhibition. It's important to be able to forget because your mind would be overwhelmed with experiences otherwise.
