# How do you Live a Life with no Regrets
reaper explores the question how do you live a life without regrets... how do you [[minimize-regret]]

each day explores a different facet of that question
regret doing the risky thing vs the not risky thing.
I should've joined that startup and followed my dream. instead I worked for megaco and died a slave. 
fight scene during that days
you repeatedly go down the same hallway
fighting the same enemies
go through their life. at the end is the boss.. the regret on their death bed. 

game opens with you pursuing the first wild emotion or whatever enemy type I am going to call them.

love plant. There's a plant that you can only own one of. Try to own anymore and the old plant eventually withers away and dies. Many attempts have been made by owners to try and own more than one but eventually only one remains in the end. Life restoration plant.

How do you live a life of no regrets. The next coffee date they talk about the previous day. 

Sometimes you can’t. Senseis philosophy is you can’t. Accept your despair. Accept that nothing could have been done. Eji is you can try. Strive. Leave it to the next generation. Nihilism. Reapers are those with regrets but have controlled their feelings. When reapers retire they’re absolved of their responsibilities (and thus their regret) eji is naive though. I’ll do what I want. Idealistic. Sense I is practical. 

And you still live a life of regrets anyways.

 Minimize regret. Regret doing something vs regretting nothing. Reperations. 

 I mean it's not even about the fame at that point. like why even perform if only five dudes are going to listen. 

 because those five dudes understand. and that's all that matters
