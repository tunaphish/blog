title: Your Work Does not Speak for Itself
---

emotions and feelings are critical to conveying things, especially as an artist. the context around something provides a frame for how your audience should view your piece. 

this includes the idea of seperating art from the artist. they are inexplicably tied. it's why ethos is one of pillars of persuasian. the context provides another way to hook people. 

it something Smart Notes mentioned in the academic world. That an idea exists in a vacuum. Once the pen hits the paper it doesn't matter what you meant. What matters is what you wrote. My mind can't help but go back to the Doctor who proposed the 24 hour oncall and how he'd regularly use cocaine. 

# Necessary to participate in society and why that doesnâ€™t make you a hypocrite 
the classic example for this is someone with left leaning economic idealogy participating in capitalistic behavior. How can someone who claims to support those kinds of policies actively engage in behavior antithecal to it. 

The reason is I need to live motherfucker. Being thrust into this society inherently means you have to engage with it on some level. That means playing according to the rules until you can come out at a stage where you can meaningfully change it. 

It is the Lelouche and.. uhh his best friend comparison where one tries to rise through the ranks and change the system from the inside vs the other who wants to tear it down and raise it back up. 

Is there still some merit to the argument though? you need to establish your character to connect with others. I want to see someone who walks the walk and establishes that ethos with me. People rip on Bernie Sanders all the time for having million dollar homes. In this specific situation it's a misunderstanding (more likely intentional mischaracterization) on what kind of scale things are applied and where lines are drawn. But the point stands that the disconnect really resonates with a lot of people.
