I struggle to decide between what I perceive to be two artistic sides of myself. 

## the game developer
Squirrel myself in a room and make art and develop my game for hours at a time. sacrificing almost every other hobby I have. cooking and fitness would take a hit as well just because of the sheer numbers required. 

## the videographer
[[content-creation]] has the full description. 
Basically, my life a movie... but taken seriously. just taking every aspect of my life and romanticising it. film. photography. art. 

## putting in the time to acquire mastery
I want to acquire true mastery. But to do so you need focus. But a little bit of everything a day?  
Eventually you would be a savant. 
Each day a narrative. 
Everyday week a project. 
Live your life a day at a time. 
Understanding the time required, what I'd need to put into it to succeed. To truly be a solo developer.

## reconciling my priorities in life 
I think I can do it all. Including art. If I specifically give up the dream of being an indie dev. I reach base level of competency over time with an hour or so dedicated to each individual activity… except game development. There’s just such breadth of specific skills you need that only apply to game development that require a base level of competency to make something anywhere near decent. I would need to sacrifice everything else, to do truly deep work. And I just can’t do that. But if I think about art. Just art. I can still manage it and live the other life I want to live. And I do want to live that life.  I’ve toyed with the idea for so long. And I know I’ll revisit it again in the future.   But for now. It’s not a path I can pursue. It’s not what makes my life worth living honestly. That’s not me talking myself out of a dream. It’s addressing all the other sides of myself that have their own wants and desires. So I’ll quiet this side of myself. For now. A good time period. I’ll grieve that side of me. And I’ll let it go. For myself. 

it comes down to priorities in life right? and I have so many more priorities over game development unfortunately.
