you've always wanted a core friend group. forming those relationships by [[favor-depth-of-experience-over-breadth]]

# scenius
great ideas are often birthed by a group of creative individuals—artists, curators, thinkers, theorists, and other tastemakers—who make up an "ecology of talent."
the best creative geniuses were often part of a whole scene of people who were supporting each other, stealing ideas, and contributing ideas.

# for your own self satisfaction and standing on the shoulders of giants
I remember having this discussion with Tucker a while back. About how you should give back to communities. Basically I said that you should participate in communities. Give back. Because this actually increases your own feelings of happiness and contentness. But that's not why you should do it. You should do it because of everything society has given to you up to this point. The collective altruism, determination, and engenuity of humankind throughout our history all allowing you to live the life that you. 

This flies in the face of [[you-did-not-consent-to-this-life]]. Why should you have these obligations to a life you never asked to be a part of.
