title: Effective altruism
---

A philsophy for philantropists to attempt to do as much good for the world as effectively as possible. This stands in contrast with how people generally pick charities which is to pick something that they are personally close with. The issue with that in somewhere like the United States is that if you usually in a fairly privileged position so the issues you are close trend towards other demographics of similar privilege. Boba asians was something that struck particularly close to me given I was a pretty big advocate for the cultural masculinity issues in the United States that asian men in deal with. 

But is that really a good use of my time? That asian dudes are struggling to get laid? Crass and a reduction of the actual issues and arguments but the point is there are other things that asians deal with that have higher priority like Stop Asian hate where I can still tackle things that are close to me while dealing with high impact issues. 

It's a common argument for BLM to rally other races around them and spotlight their issue. Black people are effectively being executed by the police legally. Nothing else matters until this is dealt with. However, take that argument worldwide though and it again forces one to shift priorities, for example Uighar Concentration Camps or the famous Bill Gates example of dealing with Malaria in Africa. Some examples of the biggest strife in the world in 2021. 

## Will it Actually Payoff?
I think one issue with applying a "Mr. Worldwide" argument to this is that what am I really going to do to help Uighar Concentration Camps or Malaria in Africa?  I can rally support to force the government to act on worldwide issues but other then that... not much. BLM is an American issue and I'm an American. I can march on the streets, donate to local BLM chapters, convince neighbhors. 

### you cannot save everyone 
Had a conversation with my mentor where he told me that you have to bet on the right horses. That their team was fairly good at sniffing out people who aren't going to make it and thus won't invest too much effort getting too too close with them The reason is it creates a conflict of interests if this person comes to you for feedback or as an advocate for getting to the next level. What do you do when you you personally like someone but they just aren't very good at their job and they want you to pitch for them? Do you tell them directly? Abstain? It's kind of like not feeding the trolls.  it's all about priorities and where to put your time.

But is it right to help the people who are already doing well? Shouldn't you invest time into trying to get people to succeed? When my team's big project at Amazon went through a crisis and our junior developers went through hell it was because [[during-crisis-the-vulnerable-are-hit-harder]]. 

The fear is that it won't payoff. In this specific example the company has an up and out mental model. Meaning that you have a limited amount of time to actually help this person before they get the axe anyways. Meanwhile this is taking away time from developing yourself or others. 

It also just sucks... It's so hard teaching people who aren't apt for it. If I am trying to [[seek-work-that-energizes-you]], then it definitely points me towards helping the capable if for the only reason that it feels good to see other people succeed because of you and it sucks to see people you try to help fail.
