title: Focus on One Thing at a Time
---
# two hat theory
Workflow that you are either refactoring or you are developing features. Never both at the same time. 

Working memory is limited and this decomposition of the problem allows you to **focus on one thing at a time.** 

This can be applied to other freeform activities like writing or drawing. You are either writing new ideas or revising your old ones. Not both at the same time. You are either drawing roughs to get your proportions right or drawing confident nice lines. Not both at the same time.
