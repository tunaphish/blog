title: Digital Garden

This is my place to tend to and nurture ideas. They often start out as sprouts from other gardens and they benefit from connecting with eachother in unexpected ways and become wholly new ideas. Hopefully, then I can mature it until they become evergreen. 

# why
So what's the purpose? To aid in understanding.. but also to inspire and this one is big for me. Digital gardens often trend towards written note taking and want to shift my focus onto videogames at some point  but a fairly visual medium. Anyways because they are visual I want to be not only be inspired visually but to flex my creative visual muscles. 

# tenets for tending to your garden 
notes should be fairly conceptual and general in nature. this helps relate ideas 
notes should be declarative. they should assert an opinion. 
notes should be atomic. use a wet and dry method. if you find yourself writing about a concept twice then extract into a common note. 
notes should be accompanied with a visual. aids in synthesis of ideas and leverages other cognitive models for learning
notes should be associated with tags

# Adding a new note
1. Add tags
2. Visual aids
3. Connections

# bauhaus for my digital garden
so while I love the digital garden allegory. the mind map doesn't seem conducive. vines? what in natural green nature looks like this? not a lot I don't think
