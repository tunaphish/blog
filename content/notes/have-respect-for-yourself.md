title: Have Respect for Yourself
---

this is the speech I wrote after a friend had yelled at me at work. this realization of having low self worth is rooted in the same idea as [[allow-yourself-to-be-vulnerable]]

that I am not worth it. But I am.

# speech to yourself and to others
It bothered me for a while and I was struggling to figure out why. And it did bother me. I took off work and didn’t do anything for the rest of the day. 

Please correct me if I have the wrong impression. You are my friend. Smart driven funny individual. Want to hang out with you on the weekend. I respect you.  And what being a friend really means to me more then anything else is I care about what you have to say. If a homeless guy says you suck I wouldn’t care. 

Your defensive statement that it was for the room and not directed at me made it worse in my mind. And that made it clear. Because Speaking to other people that way isn’t okay and that is obvious. 

Realized I didn’t apply the same standard to myself. I need to have respect for myself. I will not be scolded like a child. I’m an adult. A human being. 

But P.E. talks to people including me that way and I don’t care. Cuz he’s my coworker not my friend.

If you want to be coworkers. That’s fine.  No worries and I’ll treat you with respect no matter what. I honestly am going to act pretty similar at work regardless. I just won’t really care what you have to say about me and I won’t inject in your personal affairs either.

but I won’t be spoken to that way by a friend. Cuz I won’t care about what they have to say.
