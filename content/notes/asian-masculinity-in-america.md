title: asian masculinity in america
---

Something I've struggled with a lot growing up and to this day. 

way of man presents three core traits of traditional masculinity
1. strength
2. game (determination)
3. craftsmanship

Paying for your date, getting jacked and fighting dudes, drinking beers. All the other measures of masculinity that are perpetuated by the [[inertia-of-traditions]]

Including the ones that pervade American consciousness and prejudice against asian men. 
Height, penis size.  

# operating despite current day societal views on masculinity
[[strive-for-ideals-operate-practically]]

these things are still perpetuated though and just because you are **enlightened TM** doesn't mean shit when your [[social-capital]] is still threatened by bullshit ideas of masculinity. Like any other deal with social capital you need to amass some of it yourself before you can influence others. Even just influencing the people around you is enough, because that is what you should be striving for anyways.
