title: Writing is the Only Thing that Matters
---
Living this way doesnâ€™t mean that the way you spend your time is different. It means the way you think during that time is different. Everything becomes deliberate. If you read to write. Then you read to understand. 
If I eat to cook. I understand more. 
If I read designs to develop. Then I understand. It informs thinking.  So you keep gaming. You keep watching. Because it informs creation.
