title: Dealing with Analysis Paralysis
---
Something I struggle with a lot. I constantly find new ways to do this. From infinite research to my latest way of creating 'mood boards'. Just put something out there. You will know if it doesn't fit. 

# remember, it is an arbitrary world
As I get older the more I realize things aren’t the result of thoughtful designs but arbitrary decisions. This and the fact that there's an inertia with tradition that means decisions made arbitrarily will continue to perpetuate by virtue of having existing and persisted up until that time. 
 Have the audacity to say the world isn't representing me and I will make it happen. 

# remember, your personal value system is valid
Basically people often experience social anxiety because they take rejection
personally IE it's a measure of your social value or rank.
This is rooted in a belief that other people can measure your value and that measure is more important than yours. If you are living by your own value system than other people's opinions don't become nearly as important so their rejection doesn't lower your self esteem. If you truly believe in your own values than you can approach people, measure their value, invite them into your world and not take it too personally if they say no.

# avoid self help books → waste of time
An issue I have with a lot of self help books, productivity managers comes down to the same thing; would this time be better spent actually doing the activity itself? This stems from a disdain that I have for a lot of the self help community. People who's job is it to tell people how to be more productive instead of being productive. Why read a book on how to read a book, when I can just read a book. Especially since I have spent so so much time reading these self help books to stuffing my face with chips and playing Apex Legends.

# bias for action
ITERATION, ITERATION, ITERATION.
Be more confident in yourself. Put something down. It's easier to enunciate what's wrong with what's in front of you then what's wrong with what's in your head.

# time box yourself
Emotions are affect heuristics, they help you make decisions more quickly
the amount of time you spend researching a decision is a decision within itself

# divorce your ego from your work
Seperate yourself from your ideas, your work, your legacy. They are not you.
Does that mean you can't be proud of these things. Feel shame for them?
Yes and no. They are one part of you. One part of this world. [[your-work-does-not-speak-for-itself]] but that is in the context of presenting ideas to other in an attempt at persuasian. 
When it comes to putting your work out there in the first place. Always remember. You are not your work. 

# surface level understanding
to reduce my analysis paralysis I want to just listen to experts but it's incompatible with how I am. I have to know why otherwise I can't bring myself to just do something. happened with nutrition, development, strength training. 

experts will say to do something and unless I know why I can't do it. maybe I can get away with surface level understanding of things... but because of this I need to limit how many things I do at once.
