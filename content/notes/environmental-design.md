Building your environment to support your lifestyle. Has an incredible effect on your mood, mindset, and habits. 

# reconciling environmental design & participating in communities
trying to [[participate-in-communities]] neccesitates leaving your house and thus leaving behind your environmental design. It becomes a conscious decision then. Do you want a community surrounding this specific interest? And that is how I decide between the two. 

## for fitness
I am fine externalizing it? it's fine if you want a sense of community around it. which I currently do not have. I also obviously don't have space for it so this is a future conversation. Do I forsee fitness becoming a source of community? My answer is yes... I think so. Counterpoint is I would like to involve Rena in weightlifting and that is MUCH easier at home. so what's more important... Involving rena is more important. Solved. Get a weightlifting setup for home. 

I can find community for fitness in other ways like hot yoga classes or something of that nature. Bike rides. 

## for work
Amazon has a strong preference for "office culture" which after coming here I finally understand. There's just so much that goes on in an office that cannot be replicated through remote work: offline chats, bonding, etc. Remote work has its benefits, and they are numerous and convincing. But if you are prioritizing your career in anyway, and not EVERYBODY is remote, you are putting yourself at a disadvantage by not being in the office. 

# my ideal space
I have such a strong vision in my mind for this lifestyle. I'm not sure where it comes from. but a big open space where I live. basically a big ol art studio. there's a lofted bed I sleep at. north facing wall (not actually north but upwards) that is one big window with a ton of plants framing it. a lot of them herbs to be used in cooking. a well used kitchen where I prep most of my meals (rarely going out). on the west wall there's a bathroom that doesn't get much emphasis. on the southwest is where the entertainment area is at with a dipped section, a couch, coffee table and a large tv (maybe projector now).  on the southeast wall is where I mount my bike. it's next to a workstation with a bunch of tools on a pegboard. What I use those tools on besides my bike I don't actually know. in the center is a bunch of open space although I usually imagine some gym rings hanging down for some quick calistenics. 

the vibe is just a well put together man. it's fairly palatable to most people. I envisioned it being dark and moody for the most part. lots of dark wood and black accents and metals. very industrial. palatable for most people that's has a fairly modern masculine slant. I have a pretty regular routine and meet with people regularly but come back to this alcove. a dream from another life maybe.
