title: Cultures as a form a natural evolution

the example I'm reading about right now is japanese bath culture. They have a very rich communal bath culture. They've taken baths for millenia, adding things to this culture that enhance this experience and discarding things that don't. They bathe in natural hot springs rich in minerals. To reuse bath water they shower beforehand. Their onsen clothing is light and airy. Bath accesories are made out of hinoki wood which is naturally rot and water resistant. 

This is oftentimes why food developed over the years in a culture oftentimes taste so much better then fusion food. It's because it's had the opportunity to go through the cycles of iteration to perfect the style of food. 

However, the inertia of traditions will cause inoptimal things. And things are made for Arbitrary decisions. The guy who made doctor 24 hour oncalls regularly did cocaine.
