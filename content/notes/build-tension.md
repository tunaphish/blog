title: Build Tension
---
Somethings are meant to build anticipation. And then paying off that antcipation. your life can't be all hits. 

Suspense movies are like this. Jump scares are oftentimes derided but if there's nothing that ever shocks you then the tension building doesn't ever really amount to anything does it? It's made scarier because you are anticipating something. Sometimes the scariest scenes don't come from horror movies. Parasite was so good at this when the poor family was stuck inside the rich family's house. audiences only remembers peaks and valleys. so while they'll struggle to remember the scenes leading up to these tense ones, the tense ones are burned forever in their mind. 

People, balk at having a scheduled love making session. However, because it's something that is scheduled, you are looking forward to it. Anticipating it. This is antithetical to spontaneous sex that people generally seem to favor and pervades media because media portrays new love and not old love. Considered unromantic and unsexy. Counterpoint is that with spontaneous sex is similar to my jump scare argument. You still anticipate spontaneous sex with the added benefit that you don't know when it's coming which increases the tension.
