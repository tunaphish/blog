# ways an exocortex aligns with how people learn 
1. synthesis and deriving new ideas
2. forming connections
3. spacing and repetition

## why write notes in this style 
1. tailored: to your learning style, interests, thought processes
2. curated: how many times did you look up a recipe... only to have to filter through all the shit recipes people post online. 
3. distilled
4. externalizing my thoughts. the process of writing my thoughts out is a tool within itself for organizing information even if I never use it again. 
5. it is beautiful...
6. interconnected information 
Huge advantage of Notion over other potential note taking apps is linked pages and intra relational databases. I love being able to link things like an interconnected web vs a hierarchy. This fits together with my own thoughts about how one of the best ways to learn things is to connect it with other information within your mind. The stronger connections you create, the better your recall will be when it comes time to needing that information.

### recall training
Recall is one of the best ways of learning. Use every opportunity you can in order to train this

### structure of knowledge
structure of knowledge
1. Observation
First hand data on what occurs in the world
2. Interpretation
What your interpretation of that data is
3. Synthesis
What output it's going to have on your work, thinking, lifestyle
> Achieving Knowledge is pointless unless it has some kind of output â†’ Collector's fallacy

# curator's job
a museum curator's job is to craft a narrative to convey the message they are trying to convey they will draft a passage to frame the visitor's thoughts. then they will thoughtfully arrange a variety of pieces, from one or multiple artists that support this story. sometimes a piece will have additional supporting information. if there is still something missing sometimes they will commission artists to supplement the exhibition.
