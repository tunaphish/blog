# structure of knowledge
structure of knowledge
1. Observation
First hand data on what occurs in the world
2. Interpretation
What your interpretation of that data is
3. Synthesis
What output it's going to have on your work, thinking, lifestyle
> Achieving Knowledge is pointless unless it has some kind of output â†’ Collector's fallacy

# How to learn
> Absorb what is useful, reject what is useless, add what is essentially your own.

## [[emotions-as-an-affect-heuristic]] (the enthusiasm from a good professor, a fiction book conveying philosophy through tragic prose about human stories)
## creative projects and active engagement
a principle employed by thinking that [[writing-is-the-only-thing-that-matters]]

## visuals
## exploration (testing boundaries of ideas, disagreeing with it, synthesizing it, relating to other material, derive new ideas)
one of [[the-advantages-of-videogames-as-a-medium]]

## recall and spacing
Spaced Repetition Systems 

## Chunking
humans have limited working memory. combining information and abstracting it becomes increasingly necessary as you dive more into ecomplexity 

## Diffused vs Focused Learning

# Books are ineffective Mediums for Transferring Knowledge
How much of what you read do you really remember? In order to understand something you have to actively engage with it. This is why courses are valued over just reading the source material yourself.
There's opportunity for discourse where you synthesize against your understanding and clash with it. There's exercises to test understanding. There's tests that focus learning and provide an opportunity to review the material again. 

This is because they rely on "transmissionism" to convey information. author has knowledge. author writes that knowledge in a book. audience reads the book. audience gains the author's knowledge. this is obviously not how knowledge transfer works. 

Reading by itself does not beget understanding. 

# rereading material over time 
I read an anecdote about someone who rereads The Alchemist and everytime they read it they connect with another character. 
There is the new insight you've gained with a different perspective. But there's also the insight gained by seeing how your thinking has evolved over time. 

This is similar to the [[digital-constellation]]'s principle of evolving your ideas over time.
