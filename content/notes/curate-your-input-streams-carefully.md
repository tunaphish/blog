title: Curate your Input Streams Carefully
---
Because [[there-is-an-overwhelming-amount-of-information-in-the-world]] this practice is very important.
cal newport talked about this a lot in digital minimalism. his take is oftentimes to delete these things entirely. you don't need them. although his ultimate position was just above (to curate carefully). throwing the baby out with the bathwater imo. stands in juxtaposition with austin's show your work where you [[participate-in-communities]] so you can take advantage of social media! the ability to connect with anyone in the world and share your work. so find a balance. curate your input streams carefully. give more then you get. talk with people. show up everyday. 


# Social Media as Mediums for Gathering Information
## Tiktok
I really really like tiktok as a medium for some reason. it has huge massive flaws that I think about a lot. right now it seems like the ultimate manifestation of all the worst parts of an [[attention-economy]]. extreme ease of use. bite size information blips. the way people speak on it is oftentimes insufferable. lots of superiority on this medium as well.

yet I find myself continously getting inspired by it
sense of communities due to the way the algorithm tends to group like minded people together
"organic" exposure to other subjects I am unfamilliar with 
constant appeals to pathos over logos. contrast with communities that I generally interact or used to interact with. like reddit, blind or other dev communities. 
creative barrier to entry that is high enough that it filters out a lot of low effort content yet is low enough that people that generally wouldn't generate content for a community like youtube still participate. would say it exists in a space between youtube and instagram.  not a huge fan of instagram stories in general. because of how low low low effort they are and the vapidness of what they communicate. but I think they're good for conversation hooks. letting people ask me about my cute doggo and such.
Tiktok is king of using filmmaking and aesthetics to convey tone and atmosphere. 

## Reddit
why reddit is oftentimes pretty shitty and I've blocked it on every single 
1. another predator in the [[attention-economy]]
2. pseudo intellectualism and a sense of superiority because of it. FACTS NOT FEELINGS. 
3. truth by consensus, a byproduct of the upvote|downvote system.  
4. bias towards low effort, low substance material (man I'm talking about this a lot)
5. there is a huge bias against self promotion which stands in contrast with tiktok where it's celebrated. I can see both sides of this argument because it's fairly annoying to wade through a bunch of people trying to sell you something but I like the way that tiktok celebrates putting yourself out there and to [[allow-yourself-to-be-vulnerable]]
6. second hand opinions. try to focus on primary sources. not secondary sources. aka take the facts and come to your own observations. stop basing your opinions on other people's opinions. don't let other people tell you how to feel. (for research... not when chatting or things of that nature)


## rss feeds
there are some misc articles I get sent, blogs I want to keep track of that exist in different spheres and just newsletters I want to keep up with like the latest Gatsby news.
for this I'll use a simple RSS feed. it's the ultimate in curation since you have to actively add things to your feed instead of an algorithm feeding it to you. 

one big issue is dealing with major news sites where the rate of articles they send out make it fairly difficult to filter the ones you actually care about. sadly, just get rid of them. the noise to signal ratio isn't there. a big loss for things like japanese media (siliconera comes to mind) that you don't have other organic sources of information for (actually tiktok is filling this void quite nicely) but that's okay.
