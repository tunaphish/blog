title: Live with intention
---

Don't just mindlessly live your life. Look at yourself. How you live your life. Your habits. What you do everyday. Is this bringing you closer to your goals. Is this making you happy. Did you just do this because it was the path of least resistance.

No. Do it because you chose to do it.
