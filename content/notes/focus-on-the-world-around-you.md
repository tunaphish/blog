title: focus on the world around you
---

You can't change the world. Not right now. Maybe not ever. You are after all, just one man. But your everyday actions have impact. On your girlfriend, dogs, kids, family, coworkers, neighbors.
You impact them directly. And they impact you. And honestly. That is enough. 

The idea that you need to fix the world is pure ego. It's clear that ever increasing scope is dooming humanity in this world. Coming from a thought process that elevates humans above all others. Destroying the Earth because of the belief that we will eventually fare space and the rest of the galaxies. That may or may not be true but the damaging effects on the world limiting the sustainability of it before we can possibly achieve those lofty goals?

Local produce tastes better.
