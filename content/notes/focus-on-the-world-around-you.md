title: focus on the world around you
---

You can't change the world. Not right now. Maybe not ever. You are after all, just one man. But your everyday actions have impact. On your girlfriend, dogs, kids, family, coworkers, neighbors.
You impact them directly. And they impact you. And honestly. That is enough. 

The idea that you need to fix the world is pure ego. It's clear that ever increasing scope is dooming humanity in this world. Coming from a thought process that elevates humans above all others. Destroying the Earth because of the belief that we will eventually fare space and the rest of the galaxies. That may or may not be true but the damaging effects on the world limiting the sustainability of it before we can possibly achieve those lofty goals?

Local produce tastes better. 

# local elections
the biggest impact you can have on your life is to just focus on your local elections. specifically your mayor and not your president. 

# local art, food
eating food that is local to you is going to be the most delicious. 

# reconciling individual impact with effective altruism
[[effective-altruism]] dictates that I spend my efforts on what will have the most impact on the world. The shining example being Bill Gate's efforts on reducing Malaria in Africa. But he's also someone who has a high degree of influence on a global scale which I simply do not have. Should effective altruism scale to your global influence? Not only that but influence on a global scale might not be a good thing. My individual actions mean a lot to the community around me. Thatâ€™s enough. What that means practicallly is that I focus on the biggest impact issues where I actually hold influence.
