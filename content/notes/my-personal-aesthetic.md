title: My Personal Aesthetic
---

I've been seeing this visual trend a lot and I kind of want to emulate a guy version of it. A lot of the aesthetics are really cool. I am also probably misattributing characteristics that don't define an ABG but it's just a general inspiration for me and not necessarilly a 1:1 of what I want to achieve. Writing this out made me realize what aesthetic I want to strive for whereas it was lost on me for a while. Can't wait!
1. delicate floral tattoos
2. bleach blond hair
3. colored contacts
4. earthy toned clothing
5. aesthetic fitness 
6. DANGLY MF EARRINGS 
7. They tend to dress less conservatively but not sure how to emulate that as a male!
8. I also really love long flowing cardigans and jackets. I already have a few of them. 
9. athletic fit shirts
10. high waisted pants
11. white leather shoes
12. everlane the cotton crew
13. asrv

one big reason I am drawn so much to this aesthetic is because a lot of it runs counter to normal aesthetics that developers tend to prefer. 
1. minimalism
2. black, white neutral tones
3. RBG (saturated colors and lights)

there's [[inherent-value-in-diversity]] and introducing other aesthetics to the scene creates diversity for others but also makes you stand out.
