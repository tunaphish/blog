title: My Personal Aesthetic

# abg
I've been seeing this visual trend a lot and I kind of want to emulate a male version of it. A lot of the aesthetics are really cool. I am also probably misattributing characteristics that don't define an ABG but it's just a general inspiration for me and not necessarilly a 1:1 of what I want to achieve.

# statement pieces
This is okay. Not every piece of your wardrobe should be a statement piece. The rest of your outfit is meant to complement that statement piece. 

# list of things I like : )
1. delicate floral tattoos
2. bleach blond hair
3. colored contacts
4. earthy toned clothing
5. aesthetic fitness 
6. DANGLY MF EARRINGS 
7. They tend to dress less conservatively but not sure how to emulate that as a male!
8. I also really love long flowing cardigans and jackets. I already have a few of them. 
9. athletic fit shirts
10. high waisted pants
11. white leather shoes
12. everlane the cotton crew
13. asrv
14. base layers conveying a masculine|athletic frame
15. chains, earrings, accessories

# diversity in your space 
one big reason I am drawn so much to this aesthetic is because a lot of it runs counter to normal aesthetics that developers tend to prefer. 
1. minimalism
2. black, white neutral tones
3. RBG (saturated colors and lights)

there's [[inherent-value-in-diversity]] and introducing other aesthetics to the scene creates diversity for others but also makes you stand out. 


# otter mode
if I think about my ideal body types they generally aren't that big. they're straight otter mode. and that involves cutting. god damn rena and her love for food but not eating that much of it. that tiktok about how boyfriends get fat is so true. "babe I'm full" anyways I need to cut calories. no more drinking calories. 

# be like the sun
I've always told dylan that he is the sun. Just a big bright ball of energy that gives life and energy to everyone around him. I've always admired that about him. I've never had such flowery allegories for myself for others but for him it's just so clear and crystalized in my mind. 

I'm more cold. Demure. Probably we I have an attaction to cooler pale tones that don't stand out. But is that how I want to be? I'm not sure. I feel myself always striving in social situations but what for.
