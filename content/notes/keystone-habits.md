## Counterpoint
are so much more important then anything else. if you aren't healthy then everything else suffers. yet this isn't entirely true. this isn't what energizes me. doing this work right here. these morning papers. these mixing of ideas. this is what energizes me. 

not only that but I see people with the absolute WORST health habits. eating terribly. so how are these people able to operate? people are different I guess. I defintely need to be in tune with all my habits in order to operate effectively.
