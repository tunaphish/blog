# skincare-is-selfcare

Cologne everyday - studies show that you are more confident when you wear cologne. this translates even through photos
Less shampoo - we generally use too much cleanser in every aspect of our lives
Colder shorter showers - better for your skin than hot long showers
Scentless - conflicts with cologne and skincare
Shave every other day - I can't grow a suitable mustache unfortunately. Just keep yourself trim
