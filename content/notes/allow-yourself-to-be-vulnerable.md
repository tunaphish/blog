title: Allow yourself to be Vulnerable
---
## fear of failure
the antithesis to what I believe to be my biggest issue in life. I'm afraid of expressing my authentic self because I believe I won't be accepted. I cover it up with analysis paralysis to delay putting my work out there. Sarcasm to avoid expressing my true beliefs. Weasel words to avoid having an opinion. 

## no guilty pleasures
you like it for a reason. oftentimes the worth of something is determined arbitrarily. beauty is in the eye of the beholder and often times it just takes the right narrative  to highlight something's beauty.

## sarcasm and cynicism
referred to as the lowest form of humor because it mocks one's attempt to be vulnerable while offering nothing in return. avoid this type of humor.
