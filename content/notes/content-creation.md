# goals
 you are filming and documenting your interesting life and then crafting a narrative around it. 
- look back on my life
- try new things, experiment, projects
- just film my life casually and craft a story in the cutting room

# film [[habit-chain]]
1. identify purpose (I'm eating good ass food, having good time with rena)
2. identify style based on purpose (tiktok trends, haegreendal)
3. gather shots
    1. establishing
        1. favor motivated camera movement
    2. medium
    3. details

# edit process
## day to day [[habit-chain]]
1. export footage
2. cut favorites
    1. cut on action
3. stabilize

## edit day [[habit-chain]]
1. identify story
    1. select music: [thematic](https://hellothematic.com/)
2. group scenes 
    1. identify purpose
    2. start audio 2-3 frames before next clip
    3. maintain eyeline between zoom-ins
3. color grade

# youtube strategy
purpose → create online prescence that requires effort, document mines and rena's life
content → time periods of life, project
style → deemphasize face and voice, korean style vlogs... except faster cadence. more jokes. more camera play. emphasize audio
wide to detail cadence
timelines → videos should take a week to a month
narrative → life, inner issues

# editing things I want to learn
- creating a narrative
- color grading
- voice overs
- draw effects on my videos
- proper settings
- Better audio
- Gimbal shots
- Screen shot film
- iPhone chest mount with backpack?
- using better equipment again

# Consumption Strategy
Passive streams that feed me inspiration and updates. I should be conscious in my consumption to see how it can fuel my life. Don't mindlessly scroll. Identify why you like something, and categorize accordingly so it can be back referenced when a project down the line requires it. 
- Youtube - Cooking
- Instagram - Art, Design, Home Decor
- Tiktok - Trends, Youth

## consumption types
1. targeted (how does this help my project overall, on my tasks for the next few days)
2. curated passive consumption (thoughtful.. what do I like. what don't I, what project can this contribute to)
the science of software engineering often involves the efficient storage and retrieval of data. it makes sense to apply similar principals to personal knowledge management.
