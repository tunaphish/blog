title: Maintaining Personal Relationships
---

some of the principles I remember from that book that everyone recommends on building up your personal relationships... forgot what it's called
1. use people's names
   1. nicknames??? I'm not very good at those...
2. ask for favors (people look favorably on those give favors to)

## conflict

### validate people's feelings
Always validate the other person's feelings. This is going to come in direct contrast with how you feel. This is why there is a conflict. You are going to resist.
Listen to them, ask questions and understand the core of what they are trying to say and not just what they explicitly say. The key word is understand. 

#### including your own
Just because you are validating other's feelings doesn't mean yours aren't valid. Remember that validating others doesn't mean your feelings aren't valid. 
Assert yourself and [[allow-yourself-to-be-vulnerable]]. 

### apologies
The desire to apologize comes from my desire to be forgiven rather then my desire to find peace in the individual you are apologizing to. 
finding peace within yourself is fine. you should seek to do. but acknowledge that fact and don't shroud it in the idea that you are doing so for the other's person well being.
Their forgiveness of you is rooted in their own emotional turmoil not your own. Allow them to come to terms with that at their own pace. 

This is especially important for me and the people I happen to be close to because of the huge gulf in the time it takes to process our emotions. This is okay. 
Practically, this means allowing that individual to be angry at you. Remember to let people feel emotions fully. 

### Limit arguments to the topic at hand 
Don't bring up past grievances, you had your opportunity and chose not to. Foucs on one topic at a time. Focus on the core of the issue. And that's it. When things are resolved you can move onto other topics at hand. 
  You can use them as counter examples. To address similarities or draw comparisons. As a tool for helping people understand.
