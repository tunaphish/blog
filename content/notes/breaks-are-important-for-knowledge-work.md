# Break Length
##  Pomodoro breaks utilized during your [[deep-work-habit-chain]]
(10 minutes in between deep work sections and some longer breaks).
Avoid social media during this time. It detracts from what a break is supposed to do. While you are taking a break you are supposed to be recharging and relaxing your mind for the next deep work section. What social media does instead forces a slew of information in your brain that you then need to process.
