title: N1 Testing
---

Group studies donâ€™t tell you much about individuals. N1 testing as my first mentor, Jeff, liked to call it is what you should be doing.

IE you should just experiment with things to see what works for you. Similar to Rena's philosophy on [[skincare-is-selfcare]] that you should just try things and see if they work. Skin has such variability that whatever works for other people with similar skin types might not work for you.
