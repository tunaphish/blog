# Stoicism vs Epicureanism 
restraining yourself from all spectrum of emotion like pleasure because you believe that it somehow makes you more stoic is the opposite of stoic. partake in carnal pleasures  but do not let them control you. if that's not possible, recognize your limits as such. but for that reason and not a belief that not engaging in all life has to offer.

this is incredibly common in software engineering where people tend to idolize "logical" robotic ways of decision making and carrying yourself unaware of the fact that the implicit biases in their thought patterns trend them towards certain routes anyways. ignore the role of [[emotions-as-an-affect-heuristic]] to guide decision making.
