# staff engineer responsibilities
there's enough breadth and ambiguity at the higher levels of of a software engineering career that no two engineer's day will look exactly alike. generally, they fall into certain archetypes based on a multitide of factors, interal and external like individual personality types and external reward structures. 

## focusing attention
generally, managers don't have the viewpoint that you have into your daily work. it's your job to advocate for things that don't have enough attention. they don't know the day to day struggles surrounding bug fixing. it's your job to advocate for tooling to alleviate that. 

## writing engineering strategy
> people often conflate strategy with innovation. good strategy is boring though.
strategies and visions are concise documents that guide decision making (tenets) for teams, align priority. necessary when the same conversations keep getting rehashed or it is unclear what tech investments should be made. basically when future ambiguity gets in the way of execution for teams today
### the process
1. take five designs
2. consolidate similarities into a strategies
3. take five strategies
4. consolidate strategies into a vision


# [[how-do-you-live-a-life-with-no-regets]]
# planned spontonaiety
a principle I've seen a lot. 

- timeblocking: planning for flexibility. things will crop up last minute. 
- vacations: have a framework. some idea of what you want to do. some must hits. but then go with the flow. 

# biohacking
biohacking in general seems like something I'd be interested in although I haven't given it a lot of research. I'm fairly wary of this kind of stuff though ever since 4 hour body, that book about daily routines that was actually just shilling for supplements. 

there's solid stuff that makes inherent sense. all the [[keystone-habits]] but I don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater. 

## Using drugs to enhance creative endeavors.
1. 5-6-21 I was using edibles quite a bit this weekend and it really felt like it fueled my creative pursuits a lot. I had bursts of inspiration that I haven't had in a while for reaper and I was flying through thoughts that I've had in my mind for a long time and connecting ideas. 
2. some recent research I did into microdosing seems to support what I've been feeling. Maybe I can chat with zach a bit about this. 


# benefits of blogs as a media
1. can link to web
2. contextualized with a date
3. possibility for interactivity... 

has interactivity really been something that I care about? well I do consider it a major benefit for video games. the issue with a blog though is does it break focus? maybe not... you have to interact with something in order to understand that. I know that to be true. so the breaks in your reading aren't necessarily bad. but you do risk losing the built up mental model within your mind. from there I think that means Ideas should only be nested one. maybe two times. otherwise you risk having the context be too large. this is another thing that supports atomicity of notes. that you can't carry too much contextual information at once. 

to go back onto the topic of if I care about interactivity in blogs. I'm not sure. it's certainly cool... I want to do it. but why. what am I trying to do with it. how does it help what I am trying to do. what am I trying to do with a blog in the first place?


I'm not doing morning papers as they were intended. I want to go over these notes eventually and refine them whereas I think the original point was to just dump anything on your mind and just get a fresh start on the day. Empty your mind. There's that bruce lee idea. I should look it up. 
about taking what is useful. discarding what's not. and then adding those ideas to your repetoire. 

# how to read books
> Absorb what is useful, reject what is useless, add what is essentially your own. 
> -- Bruce Lee

After thinking a lot about [[metacognition]] I've been obsessed with actually absorbing the material that I am consuming. But is all the material really useful? 
I've seen the idea about focusing on what resonates with you. 

I read an anecdote about someone who rereads The Alchemist after life events and how each time they read it they connect with a different character. People tend to only remember the peaks and ending of a film. 

If everything is meaningful then nothing is. This is okay. Not every piece of your wardrobe should be a statement piece. The rest of your outfit is meant to complement that statement piece. 
Somethings are meant to build anticipation. Building anticipation. And then paying off that antcipation. 


# morning pages - june 8th
guess that's it so far lmao. being human. connecting with others. but also fueling rich and exciting work. maybe you can do both at the same time? discord communities are a lot better for these kinds of things. I can join my family discord. go in there during break times. during lunch time... maybe I'll start doing that. connect with kevin.. vinhcent. maybe even my brother lol. is there a cap on this stream of consciousness writing. I'll cap it here and take a look online. 

write everything. revise later. you operate on one mode at a time. its like the [[two-hat-theory]] from refactoring. just focus on one thing a time. exeriment with new processes. see what works for you. shake things up dramatically. this week's focus was on getting the zettlekesten going. and it's been a raging success. what was next week again?
need to find time when I have energy to revise these notes haha. I'll just do it during the review time period I already have scheduled for myself at the end of each day. 


ween yourself out of as much glue work as possible, including logistical meetings.  
focus on deep work if you can. this is selfish yes.

# morning papers - june 9th

so what am I writing about this morning. stream of consciousness. maybe I'm done after all! that was fast. 

last night I stayed up til like 2am. I still have these regressions which suck but I'm not too worried about it like I once was. There's optimizing yourself and your energy levels.
but there's also resilience right? Maybe I should read grit. I kind of want to start a book club or something. I really love these fantasy playlists. The person is posting their universe. The associated drawing. A playlist with it. Everything's just... chill. So yeah I do think there's room for more creative elements in this space. It feels like a tool dominated by academics and programmers. Philosophy. So while those subjects do interest me. I want this to be a place where I make creative connections as well you know. 

I'm quite happy that people are starting to come into the office again.. I really needed these human connections haha. Well... I think that is it. Maybe I'm too tired. There actually isn't too much springing to my mind right now. 

Wonder why it was so hard for me to sleep last night. I did spend a fair amount of time. 

Maybe I'll add a storybook at some point. It'd be cool to have that viewpoint on all the components I've created over the years. 

This is the first personal site where I truly felt connected with it. Every other time I was just doing the usual rote thing. Create a blog. Put your portfolio here. But this style truly resonates with me and is super unique. 


for my daily writing habit chain I think I'll spend maybe 40 minutes on writing whether it's morning habits or it's a topic imposed here. afterwords I'll spend like 20 minutes on revision. 


what messages am I trying to convey to the world? there's a parallel between working hard, doing the same thing over and over again and video games. or something. visual novels. 


I spent a lot of time on tiktok yesterday as well. wasn't particularly inspired by anything I saw. should limit down that time even further. 
I should figure out what's we should do for non high spa nights... haha



# morning papers - jun 10th
## this weekend with lana
hello again me! nice to see you. Today's my last working day and I am not looking forward to this weekend. Lana's going to be staying at my place for the weekend. I kind of just need to force muyself to do things though because I never look forward to anything but when I look back or even when it's happening I always think, I'm glad I did it. We're supposed to be doing ranier saturday. Will have a nice picnic at the bottom or something. Probably run some errands or something. 

## yesterday's suntime funtime.
Yesterday was a blast though. A bunch of people came to the office and had an amazing time. In the morning we played with the dogs, got poke and took a long lunch by the spheres and then just relaxed in the afternoon. Feeling pretty recharged honestly. **I really enjoy eating outside by the spheres.** I think that's one takeaway is that I'm going to consistently head out there for some suntime. Maybe I'll take bear with me as well. Hope Rena can eventually compound her breaks and she can come meet me by the spheres to grab something to eating

jas, krushi and tadeo should be coming around today so that'll be fun.

## constellations
I eventually decided on a theme for my project. Constellations. I love Maggie's garden allegory. However, her focus is on the idea of growing your ideas over time (which is something I still want to implement) but I'm putting a lot more emphasis on the interconnectivity of ideas. In the DAG they straight up look like stars in the sky. There's no way I couldn't call it a constellation. The second runner up was how they kind of looked like neurons firing in a brain. In the end I'm a sucker for the stars though. Somebody should take that idea though because there's a lot more obvious parallels with creating an exocortex. 

### tackiness
there was that tiktok that discussed how you actually brand something. I need to come back to that because I might be slipping too far into tackiness. Like I was thinking about converting my phish logo into a zodiac sign looking thing haha. whereas you should be trying to emphasize

### warmth in space
space has a strong association with cold tones for good reason. deep, nebulous vacuum void of space. However, the way I wanted to trend my life. the colors I've been attaching myself to have been warm. I think there's a real void in my life for that kind of stuff. I'm closer to a Type A person. Fairly logically minded, in a software engineering position surrounded by that type. Just want to be a more well rounded person. anyways this was a long winded way of saying I wanted the theming to convey more warmth and be more inviting. 

# jun 11th

yesterday was tiring but fun. got to spend a fair amount of time socializing at work and hanging out with lana and jason who's visiting. kizuki wasn't as bad (to me) this time around although I definitely won't be going back. 

read a few more passages from staff engineer.
## to lead you have to follow
## stay aligned with authority
you have to be able to execute on your leaders plans. another passage that comes back to alignment. obviously you've arrived here because you are a leader but part of being means aligning worldviews with others. 

the power an individual can achieve pales in comparison to what an organization can achieve. the trade off is aligning those worldviews and sacrificing your unique vision. how does this scale up to a mega conglomerate like Amazon? each individual voice is lost in a sea of others but there's some guiding vision. some shared worldview all pushing us in the same direction? enacting an enormous prescence on the world. 

# jun 12th

yesterday was a fairly exhausting day. we went rock climbing and then to gameworks. my hands are tight attempting to type this lol. 

I thought a lot about whether or not I'd invest time into learning how to rock climb. today we're supposed to ride go karts. That lead me to think about how we've been doing a lot of like (fun but random activities). Fun for fun's sake is fine butit made me think about caleb's chat about exposure and time which is a rehash of the [[favor-depth-of-experience-over-breadth]] argument. he had another take that I hadn't considered but it was just opportunity cost. I guess this only applies to certain things but at any point you can drop something and get more exposure somewhere else. but that means you have to invest that time again if you want to acquire a similar level of depth there. 

knowledge workers generally don't train their fundamentals. 


abundance mentality
growth mentality
truly believing in yourself 
building tension and anticipation 
audience only remembers peaks and valleys

# jun 13th

To provide sponsorship you have to be in the room. Need mentorship to understand sponsorship. 

Leaders have a clear idea of how things ought to be. And care enough to make it so. 

Misunderstood. Is usually right. Eventually right. Not every meeting they came into with right answer. Arrive at the right answer. Some ways are by Meeting everyone’s needs. Making Little bets. Keeping doors open.

I'm just not someone who enjoys speed



I can finally read from my kindle again now that I've resolved not to take notes at night

[[pareto-principle]] for clothing would just be fit 
base layers should convey atheltic and masculine frame. 

food with friends -> [[focus-on-one-thing-at-a-time]]
two hat theory (in dev workflow),  you are developing features. or you are refactoring. rule of thumb is one doesn't break or add tests. the other does. -> [[focus-on-one-thing-at-a-time]]

# clear your mind
In the morning I strive to get working on my knowledge work as fast as possible so the actual routine is fairly minimal. Some hygiene for myself and the dogs and coffee then it's a short walk to the office. Then it's a few exercises to clear my mind like [[inbox-zero]] and morning papers. After that I eat the frog and focus on design work if possible. I try to figure out what decisions I need to make throughout the day and make those decisions, this generally  means that design work (the hardest work) is done in the morning. these tasks are generally punctuated using pomodoro's. the break time should be used to address whatever was my biggest distraction from getting into [[flow-state]]. sometimes this is my lower back pain so I'll do a few stretches. other times it's my need to socialize so I'll play with the dog or chat with my coworkers. . sometimes it's just a general lack of focus. of which can usually be cleared with some meditation. 

# training inputs
[[do-not-touch-your-mouse]] ... another idea for some dexterity work but just a good way of increasing your flow state. a good idea for a video! there's even a website for it. video starts off with me standing up and throwing my mouse straight in the trash. I'll even have an after credits scene where I dig my mouse out of the trash because you need your mouse at least some of the time. one of the biggest ones would probably be how to navigate safari with just my keyboard. another fun experiment would be doing my morning papers through dictation instead of physically typing it myself. I think the biggest issue would be creating links though actually. I never noticed but this intellij isn't just for spelling. It is actually suggesting markdown shortcuts which is pretty cool. 

I have lots of stray thoughts throughout the day that I'd like to record. wonder what would be the mechanism for that. Generally I want to use these morning sessions to do so but lightning strikes at odd times. 

# knowledge training fundamentals
what would be considered fundamentals for knowledge work. when can I do this too. might be a good way of kicking off my mechanical work session. these are the kinds of skills I want to keep fresh in my mind. another video idea. training fundamentals for knowledge work and developing an SRS system from my exocortex (constellations). 
1. recall
2. problem decomposition (leetcode? are they fundamentals) TDD : )


another reason why reddit sucks. second hand opinions. try to focus on primary sources. not secondary sources. aka take the facts and come to your own observations. stop basing your opinions on other people's opinions. don't let other people tell you how to feel. (for research... not when chatting or things of that nature)

these notes rarely reflect my final or even my actual thoughts. some may be contradictory to what I think. however, to fully empower this method of notetaking I need to be able to link ideas, reconcile conflicting ideas or even discredit some of them. 

videos are good because they emphasize other skills that I lack. like speaking or conveying espression. things of that nature.
