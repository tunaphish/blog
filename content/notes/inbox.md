# biases
there are many biases to be aware of when you write, ponder, persuade. try to avoid (or abuse) these when going about your intellectual pursuits and knowledge work. 

survivorship bias
recency bias
easily retrievable bias
abstraction bias
exposure bias
tunnel effect


# cliques and exclusionary behavior as it relates to my team
> **clique**: a small group of people, with shared interests or other features in common, who spend time together and do not readily allow others to join them.

The important part is do not readily allow others to join them. 
The greater issue with cliques is making others to feel like outsiders. To not be a part of the clique is to suffer. 
Exclusionary behavior oftentimes comes up in my writing because I really like the idea of nobility and noble houses who often practice these sorts of things. 
Hereditary bloodlines that pass on leaders to the new rold 


# capitalism 
Capitalism assumes most efficient means of production is driven my human selfishness. That innovation is driven by that. I don’t believe that’s true. Money is influence and insteads launches wickedness to highest power. Game theory rewards selfish behavior. Selfish individuals get to the top.  Money is influence. Power over the world. Trite statements. 

Capitalism. Promotes inequality. Which stifles innovation from particular flavor of capitalism. Economics are a moving spectrum. Same with politics. It’s the sliding window of acceptable policy. 

Efficient means of product was best way to propogate humanity. Now it’s not. Fucking the world.

# work effort theory in corporations
This theory applies to office workers where they do not have equity in the company. 
Why invest yourself so much where you won’t benefit. The idea is work hard get promoted and that is where you see benefit. Is this the way it plays out though? Is it really worth it?
It is inherently disproportionate the value you generate for a company vs your compensation. Why tip the scales even further but giving more of your time to a company?

The argument for why it's acceptable for a company to take more money is because they take on the risk. But that becomes unacceptable after a certain point. It's not a blank check. It's a sliding scale for more risk that you take on, the more cash you are entitled to. It is also not zero risk. You can lose your job at the whim of your employer.

The argument for software developers a lot of the time is just leave a company after a couple years and use lateral movement to move up. companies seem to reward this behavior as well with expiring bonuses.

# reconciling agile and long term planning
- have long term goals
- agile
  
I keep going between mapping a year to see where you could place yourself. And then just focusing on what you are going to do this week. 
The farther out you plan the more ambiguity there is. with literally everything. The things I wanted a year ago aren't the things I want now. 
Here I realized I don't know what agile actually means. it's just some nebulous term that people throw about to describe... idk it's really vague. 

# random topics
- Mental model. Life is a performance. goffman

# Virtue signaling
> the action or practice of publicly expressing opinions or sentiments intended to demonstrate one's good character or the moral correctness of one's position on a particular issue
 
(relation to the internet)
the desire to show that you are a good person rather than actually just being a good person. exacerbated by the internet (trick mirror) because your internet personality is just your thoughts and expressions... that's it. there are no actions... are there? 

(actions vs thoughts)
am I good person deep down? 
there is no deep down. you are what you do. 
the road to hell is paved with good intentions. 
discussed in atomic habits as well. you are what you do. what's that quote. 

(relation to myself and my superiority inferiority paradox) 
this aligns with my superiority/inferiority complex paradox. I judge others by their actions whereas I judge myself by my potential. My surface level thoughts give me a superiority complex but in my core I know that isn't true and that it's your actions are what matter which is why I still have an inferiority complex. I haven't done anything. 

# "real" art vs digital art
Before I conclusively said digital art was the way I wanted to go because the hobbies I decided for myself at the time. Game development. Making stickers and shit. 

Recently though I've discovered a tenet for myself regarding balance. Most of my inclinations push me towards online life. My job, video games, gathering information. 

My other hobbies should trend the other direction if possible. Plus I am discovering a lust (weird word choice) for real life. In that other things are taking precedent. Taste, textures, smells. All food related... But basically living life in my flesh isntead of my just my mind which online life exacerbates. 

Eh fuck it I can do both. I did need to write this down though. 

# argument against exposure|recency bias
Algorithms reinforcing your interests and likes. Presented as bad. As an echo chamber. Isn’t that different right from real life. If you think about a farmer constantly exposed to same thing over and over. It’s curation. Exposure bias says people tends towards things they see often. But things you see often is often a good indicator that it’s important. The best indicator that you’ll run into some situation is if you’ve run into that situation before. Its sort of like habits in that way. 

# feminism 
women make a likability trade off more then men be side of the expectation for women to be more submissive and less aggressive. 
[[naming-is-hard]]. Feminism has (sometimes intentional on both sides) misconceptions about the superiority of women over men. Quick google for the definition 
> the advocacy of women's rights on the basis of the equality of the sexes.

Equality being the key word which I think most people agree with. Issue for most people against feminism is the prospect that there is an inequality to begin with I suppose. 

men latched onto "acting homo" with their buddies because it's one of the only ways to display genuine affection for your friends without sacrificing traditional masculinity. [[allow-yourself-to-be-vulnerable]] and just tell him he has a nice dick. 

# democracy
the greater the dispersion of power, the better. stops malicious individuals from fucking around. argument for democracy. 
there's a quote about preventing individuals from gaining too much power
mankind is stupid. man is smart. natural leaders. (red rising, golden son) I cannot find the quote online for the life of me lol



# hypergamy (incel theory)
Women have their pick of men. They want a good man. 

Biological instinct for men is to be with multiple women. Vs women to lock down one good man. 

Feminism doesn’t exclude men’s issues per say. It’s about equality. Men are free to join together and voice their issues as well. 

The fact that men do not voice their issues is proof that men have the more beneficial position in life. This is muddied by the fact that one of the issues men deal with is not communicating their issues. 

Or maybe it’s compounded by increased sympathy for women aka damsel in distress which causes female issues to take more light. 

Hypergamy. Friendship paradox.

# Intuitive cooking and eating

# racism and statistics
When it comes to mental differences. Individuality varies so much that using sex or race as any kind of indicator makes no sense. But does it make sense when speaking in generalities and trends. That’s the argument the google manifesto guy was talking about. Cultural factors effect these things. The meme stat about black crime is often brought up outside of the context of increased policing in minority neighborhoods or the correlation between being poor and committing crime. But once we do away with those factors if there was just a difference in mental biology that pre determines behavior in certain ways that only manifests itself as trends and generalities. Do you police against that.  

Generalities play out that way but world is full of nuance and subtlety that it doesn’t fit. It’s the difference between theory and practice. The devil is in the details. 

Toxoplasma theory


# Strength Goals
If I am consistent with linear progression I can think about moving off of this program like 10 months out... (current date july 1st 2021) If I am consistent. with deadlift being the biggest laggard. I do see myself stalling on upper body lifts twice causing me to have to switch off for upper body but continue down linear progression for lower body.

Yesterday I squatted more weight then I've squatted in a long time and my lower back felt FUCKED. Actually thinking about it did I squat 2 plate in college? 

# what I want out of Life
don't make your entire life about art. front end development kind of leans in that direction but ehhh. 

# thoughts
yesterday I was just really tired. 

encourages dispassionate feeling. logic. that's not what I want to be all the time even though that's my modus operandi. 

there's a sense of superiority in male dominated spaces (reddit, development) about transcending popular culture. things like not giving a shit about your appearance. how you come across to other people. ignoring feelings. 

I think I've been obsessing over this topic a lot because it was who I am for a while. I didn't go off the deep end... but I could have. Similar to high school me who was a creep (in my dicussion with a fellow peer he related the same things) and how I obsessed with inceldom when it came out. THAT WAS ME. 

how do you make a palatable incel lol. traditionally it's just someone who's an outsider to the dating world who wants to break in. 

money isn't everything. not having it is. for a lot of people sex is a very similar thing.

abg's and gyarus (americancore)

with great power comes great responsibility

Internet provided an outlet for change without meaningfully effecting anything. Before you had to go somewhere and it effected meaningfully because it was local. 

Professional opinion havers. Aka influencers. Changing how you think. Changing your cognitive bias. 



# my ideal space
I have such a strong vision in my mind for this lifestyle. I'm not sure where it comes from. but a big open space where I live. basically a big ol art studio. there's a lofted bed I sleep at. north facing wall (not actually north but upwards) that is one big window with a ton of plants framing it. a lot of them herbs to be used in cooking. a well used kitchen where I prep most of my meals (rarely going out). on the west wall there's a bathroom that doesn't get much emphasis. on the southwest is where the entertainment area is at with a dipped section, a couch, coffee table and a large tv (maybe projector now).  on the southeast wall is where I mount my bike. it's next to a workstation with a bunch of tools on a pegboard. What I use those tools on besides my bike I don't actually know. in the center is a bunch of open space although I usually imagine some gym rings hanging down for some quick calistenics. 

the vibe is just a well put together man. it's fairly palatable to most people. I envisioned it being dark and moody for the most part. lots of dark wood and black accents and metals. very industrial. palatable for most people that's has a fairly modern masculine slant. I have a pretty regular routine and meet with people regularly but come back to this alcove. a dream from another life maybe. 

# mind dump
yesterday 
everytime I buy new clothes I should pose with it and take a pic
Not paid according to how hard you work. Rather how hard you are to replace. 
one issue with not planning the night before is I often forget what targeted research I should be doing. 

yesterday was kind of a meh day. didn't really accomplish much. went to a harbor city which rena absolutely loathed : )
then we went to get some snacks that she was dissapointed by. life sucks and then you die!

> My only experience of the world ahs been one in which personal appeal is paramount and self-exposure is encouraged; this legitimately unfortunate paradigm, inhabited first by women and now generalized to the entire internet, is what trolls loathe and actively repudiate. They destablize an internet built on transparency and likability. They pull us back towards the chaotic and the unknown

# taking weightlifting more seriously
Actually doing research in it again. There's a lot of concepts I keep close to chest like compound lifting and linear progression but there's is actually a lot of nuance sometimes. 
Hmm might be digging too far into the weeds though. Remeber pareto principle and to focus on the most important things. In this case, lift heavy, eat protein and sleep a lot. 

There's one addendum to this for me though and that is avoid lower back injury! Squatting and deadlifting have been consistently fucking me up and I need to stay vigilant about it. I think core work is something obvious I am lacking that I need to work on before looking into other things. I should also make sure deep stretching my back after working out is not exacerbating things. 

# ebike vs regular bike
There are a lot of things that are kind of far to actually walk but make sense to bike for. Even if I just leave this bike at the office : O 
If I bring the dog backpack I carry pixel on my back and just carry her out to rena's fairly easily. Although it's like a five minute walk either way.

But I won't be as against errands. Or dashing back to the apartment. I wonder if there are people out there who do bike deliveries just for funsies. There's actually not a lot of downside for that. 

ebike 
- actually travel distances (can I actually handle half an hour commutes on a bike? I'm not sure...)

bike
- I own it 
  - I can customize it
-
