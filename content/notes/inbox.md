I just realized, the glitch effects actually swap Aubrey’s color pallet with her dream world counterpart. Not sure if intentional, but really cool for sure

# feminism 
setting and meeting expectations is incredibly important. in the world of work that manifests itself as the tenet of **underestimate, overdeliver**. A boss would rather the employee who estimates average output and delivers outputs instead of the employee who estimates perfect output and delivers great output. the second employee performed more but did not meet expectations. this is where biases hurt women in the workplace. Because the perceived bias for women is to be likeable, warm, and friendly; women make a likability trade off more then men. this manifests itself as women being forced to couch opinions when the same opinion can be vouched by men more aggressively and with more confidence. 

[[naming-is-hard]]. Feminism has (sometimes intentional on both sides) misconceptions about the superiority of women over men. Quick google for the definition 
> the advocacy of women's rights on the basis of the equality of the sexes.
Equality being the key word which I think most people agree with. Issue for most people against feminism is the prospect that there is an inequality to begin with I suppose. 

# feminism and mens rights activists
Feminism doesn’t exclude men’s issues per say. It’s about equality. Men are free to join together and voice their issues as well. 

The fact that men do not voice their issues is proof that men have the more beneficial position in life. This is muddied by the fact that one of the issues men deal with is not communicating their issues. Or maybe it’s compounded by increased sympathy for women aka damsel in distress which causes female issues to take more light. 


# Internet's Cultural Impact
In her essay about the internet it discusses how the internet is degrading culture, community and sense of identity. 
When I last referenced this topic I chose to expound on the internet's benefits through productivity and economy, although I ultimately concluded that those weren't necessarily good things. 
But that's not what the topic is about. It's more about the soul. So can I say that the internet has been good for people's sense of self, community and culture? The ability to find other's in your stupid niche circles. 

Stay connected with your friends across the country. [[focus-on-the-world-around-you]] argues that you should just forget about those friends and not know what they are doing lol. In the past when you didn't have a circle of friends you could turn to in real life you pretty much had to move to the city or something or accept your life of solitude. [[participate-in-communities]] is key to success. I know this to be true. 

The internet gives you options but there's also the argument against having an overabundance of options. 

# discords as community hubs
it all started with the halo days on those custom servers. I still think that was the epitome because it was so easy to create commmunities by hosting your own servers. people naturally congregated around the same servers and you actually got to know people and join clans. with a game as baseline as halo you even saw people develop playstyles. I remember bigzilla constantly grabbing the sniper, sticky rice doing some sneaky shit and myself gravitating to the banshee. those days were so much fun lol. the custom servers where you'd play zombies. playing with my brother and kevin. they still play together to this day in discords. that was probably the natural evolution of online gaming communities after after years of ranked online play. 

# launch but really apex legends... and then not much else
