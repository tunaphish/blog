# what ideas are interesting to actually write about
Ideas in a vaccuum aren't that interesting to explore. How they connect and contratst with other ideas is what is interesting 

# divorce your ego from your work
Seperate yourself from your ideas, your work, your legacy. They are not you.
Does that mean you can't be proud of these things. Feel shame for them?
Yes and no. They are one part of you. One part of this world. 

# billionaires and space
need to amass fortune, global opportunities and human invention to move into space. but is that right? earth is being sacrificed. send stuff to mars for a billion dollars vs investing a billion dollars into making the world more habitable. 

# scope of work
I should probably limit personal projects at work to an hour or two. I still need to succeed at my job and it's a little too much hubris to assume I can just spend half my time doing other stuff. 

I've also done a surprisingly good job of phasing out my mindless internet use... I wonder what happened. Do I feel any different? I have that time period after work for some mindless tiktoks... but other than that. 

As for that tiktok time I'm not feeling particularly inspired by it anymore. Maybe it's the fact that I can't get very invested in such a short format. Is there any off the top of my head that I still think about. 

I should take those things that bianca sent seriously. Plus put more of an effort into my friendships with the people at work.

# random topics
avoid weasal words. assert your opinion
Survivorship bias
Restrict volatility on things that don’t matter. This is where experience comes in handy. You can tell what doesn’t matter.

# apologies
the desire to apologize comes from my desire to be forgiven rather then my desire to find peace in the individual you are apologizing to. 
finding peace within yourself is fine. you should seek to do. but acknowledge that fact and don't shroud it in the idea that you are doing so for the well being. 
Practically, this means allowing that individual to be angry at you 

Limit arguments to the topic at hand (don't bring up past grievances, you had your opportunity and chose not to)
  you can use them as counter examples. 
Validate feelings


- your initial point was the team should have more empathy. I think you were referring to getting donunted three days in a row. But from my perspective I did that. I finished my doc. Saw an opportunity to donut you. Realized you took a call in the middle of standup and decided to let it go. And you yelled at me like a child regardless. 
- you do childish shit all the time and I don't care (you said you are trying to fit in... but in the current social dynamic it's pretty clear that you are an active partcipant), granted this time you were going through something but I wasn't aware of that. 
- you even agreed that's not how you speak to people from the alexa example  yet you popped off in the same way
- what you did was worse, you've acknowledged it. But do you really think so. The bulk of our conversation is surrounding the donuting. (this may not be true) he was outlaying his feelings leading up to his pop off which is still about the pop off. Will let t his slide. 


remember to feel things fully. embrace it. and then let it go. 

Sometimes you don’t have a passion in life. You go from one interest to another til you die. That’s okay. 

# reconciling individual impact with globalization

My individual actions mean a lot to the community around me. That’s enough. 
This is stemming from my belief that focus should be given on the community around you. 
Influence on a global scale might not be a good thing


# Romanticesize your life. 

Filming videos of your life is one way of doing so. By being conscious of how you would like to portray it to other people you find more clarity in your vision.

# Capitalism : ) 
Capitalism assumes most efficient means of production is driven my human selfishness. That innovation is driven by that. 

I don’t believe that’s true. Money is influence and insteads launches wickedness to highest power. Game theory rewards selfish behavior. Selfish individuals get to the top.  Money is influence. Power over the world. Trite statements. 

Capitalism. Promotes inequality. Which stifles innovation from particular flavor of capitalism. Economics are a moving spectrum. Same with politics. It’s the sliding window of acceptable policy. 

Efficient means of product was best way to prop rotate humanity. Now it’s not. Fucking the world.

# work effort theory
Why invest yourself so much where you won’t benefit. The office theory of Jim’s and Dwights and Michaels.  

# reconciling agile and long term planning
I keep going between mapping a year to see where you could place yourself. And then just focusing on what you are going to do this week. 

The farther out you plan the more ambiguity there is.. with literally everything. The things I wanted a year ago aren't the things I want now. 


# fitness
do I have a spot for fitness? 

I keep going between mapping a year to see where you could place yourself. And then just focusing on what you are going to do this week. 

As egotistical as it is. You have to establish ethos. Social capitol before stepping out of the lines. That means actually being fit. 

# giving up game development
I struggle to decide between what I perceive to be two artistic sides of myself. I want to acquire true master. But to do so you need focus. But a little bit of everything a day?  

Eventually you would be a savant. 

Each day a narrative. 

Everyday week a project. 

Live your life a day at a time. 

I think I can do it all. Including art. If I specifically give up the dream of being an indie dev. I reach base level of competency over time with an hour or so dedicated to each individual activity… except game development. There’s just such breadth of specific skills you need that only apply to game development that require a base level of competency to make something anywhere near decent. I would need to sacrifice everything else. To do truly deep work. And I just can’t do that. But if I think about art. Just art. I can still manage it and live the other life I want to live. And I do want to live that life.  I’ve toyed with the idea for so long. And I know I’ll revisit it again in the future.   But for now. It’s not a path I can pursue. It’s not what makes my life worth living honestly. That’s not me talking myself out of a dream. It’s addressing all the other sides of myself that have their own wants and desires. So I’ll quiet this side of myself. For now. A good time period. I’ll grieve that side of me. And I’ll let it go. For myself. 

Understanding the time required, what I'd need to put into it to succeed. To truly be a solo developer.

# fundamentals
The better your aim is. The riskier play you can make and come out on top. Lower skill players have to play differently. 

# naming is hard

in development. conveying meaning. aligning mental models.
