# staff engineer notes
## expectations
I want to get a grasp on what my career tract is likely to look like and the role I am going to play and the skills I need to develop

## types
1. tech lead
2. architect
3. problem solver
4. the right hand

## benefits
1. credentials
2. pay
3. being in the room aka influence

## responsibilities

## work on what matters
no ghosts, playing the game too much or snacking
1. exisistential threads
2. things lacking attention
3. editing and finishing things
4. growth
5. doing only what you can

## writing engineering strategy
> people often conflate strategy with innovation. good strategy is boring though.
strategies and visions are concise documents that guide decision making (tenets) for teams, align priority. necessary when the same conversations keep getting rehashed or it is unclear what tech investments should be made. basically when future ambiguity gets in the way of execution for teams today
## the process
1. take five designs
2. consolidate similarities into a strategies
3. take five strategies
4. consolidate strategies into a vision

tip for design is to keep crafting your problem statement until your solution is clear
## current summary
defines what a staff engineer is, their responsibilities, the archetypes and why you want to be one and the ways to get into that tract

# Using drugs to enhance creative endeavors.
1. 5-6-21 I was using edibles quite a bit this weekend and it really felt like it fueled my creative pursuits a lot. I had bursts of inspiration that I haven't had in a while for reaper and I was flying through thoughts that I've had in my mind for a long time and connecting ideas. 
2. some recent research I did into microdosing seems to support what I've been feeling. Maybe I can chat with zach a bit about this. 



# benefits of blogs as a media
1. can link to web
2. contextualized with a date
3. possibility for interactivity... 

has interactivity really been something that I care about? well I do consider it a major benefit for video games. the issue with a blog though is does it break focus? maybe not... you have to interact with something in order to understand that. I know that to be true. so the breaks in your reading aren't necessarily bad. but you do risk losing the built up mental model within your mind. from there I think that means Ideas should only be nested one. maybe two times. otherwise you risk having the context be too large. this is another thing that supports atomicity of notes. that you can't carry too much contextual information at once. 
to go back onto the topic of if I care about interactivity in blogs. I'm not sure. it's certainly cool... I want to do it. but why. what am I trying to do with it. how does it help what I am trying to do. what am I trying to do with a blog in the first place?


I'm not doing morning papers as they were intended. I want to go over these notes eventually and refine them whereas I think the original point was to just dump anything on your mind and just get a fresh start on the day. Empty your mind. There's that bruce lee idea. I should look it up. 
about taking what is useful. discarding what's not. and then adding those ideas to your repetoire. 


# work and personal digital garden...
anything project specific can live in project wikis. although the benefits from being a part of my exocortex are gone. but really I should be taking general conceptual ideas from my projects and cross pollinating them with my other ideas. that means it doesn't really matter if specifics to my job aren't in my garden. that's fine 


# About me
Hi, I'm Tuan, a software engineer at Amazon Music. 

Welcome to my [[digital-garden]]!

Here is where I post my thoughts, tend to them, grow new ones and cross pollinate them. 

If you don't know where to start why not go to my [[inbox]]. It's where I jot down anything currently on my mind until it finds a home. 
Alternatively, the graph you see behind the text is actually a web of how my notes are interconnected and clicking on any node will take you to that note with the graph being a subset of the ideas that are connected to it. 

If you see anything that provokes you feel free to chat with me about it at <--INSERT SOCIAL MEDIA HERE YOU RECLUSE!--> Right now I am trying to [[participate-in-online-communities]] more often. 


# morning pages - june 8th
guess that's it so far lmao. being human. connecting with others. but also fueling rich and exciting work. maybe you can do both at the same time? discord communities are a lot better for these kinds of things. I can join my family discord. go in there during break times. during lunch time... maybe I'll start doing that. connect with kevin.. vinhcent. maybe even my brother lol. is there a cap on this stream of consciousness writing. I'll cap it here and take a look online. 

write everything. revise later. you operate on one mode at a time. its like the [[two-hat-theory]] from refactoring. just focus on one thing a time. exeriment with new processes. see what works for you. shake things up dramatically. this week's focus was on getting the zettlekesten going. and it's been a raging success. what was next week again?
need to find time when I have energy to revise these notes haha. I'll just do it during the review time period I already have scheduled for myself at the end of each day. 


ween yourself out of as much glue work as possible, including logistical meetings.  
focus on deep work if you can. this is selfish yes.

# morning papers - june 9th

so what am I writing about this morning. stream of consciousness. maybe I'm done after all! that was fast. 

last night I stayed up til like 2am. I still have these regressions which suck but I'm not too worried about it like I once was. There's optimizing yourself and your energy levels.
but there's also resilience right? Maybe I should read grit. I kind of want to start a book club or something. I really love these fantasy playlists. The person is posting their universe. The associated drawing. A playlist with it. Everything's just... chill. So yeah I do think there's room for more creative elements in this space. It feels like a tool dominated by academics and programmers. Philosophy. So while those subjects do interest me. I want this to be a place where I make creative connections as well you know. 

I'm quite happy that people are starting to come into the office again.. I really needed these human connections haha. Well... I think that is it. Maybe I'm too tired. There actually isn't too much springing to my mind right now. 

Wonder why it was so hard for me to sleep last night. I did spend a fair amount of time. 

Maybe I'll add a storybook at some point. It'd be cool to have that viewpoint on all the components I've created over the years. 

This is the first personal site where I truly felt connected with it. Every other time I was just doing the usual rote thing. Create a blog. Put your portfolio here. But this style truly resonates with me and is super unique. 


for my daily writing habit chain I think I'll spend maybe 40 minutes on writing whether it's morning habits or it's a topic imposed here. afterwords I'll spend like 20 minutes on revision. 


what messages am I trying to convey to the world? there's a parallel between working hard, doing the same thing over and over again and video games. or something. visual novels. 


I spent a lot of time on tiktok yesterday as well. wasn't particularly inspired by anything I saw. should limit down that time even further. 
I should figure out what's we should do for non high spa nights... haha
