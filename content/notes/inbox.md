# feminism 
setting and meeting expectations is incredibly important. in the world of work that manifests itself as the tenet of **underestimate, overdeliver**. A boss would rather the employee who estimates average output and delivers outputs instead of the employee who estimates perfect output and delivers great output. the second employee performed more but did not meet expectations. this is where biases hurt women in the workplace. Because the perceived bias for women is to be likeable, warm, and friendly; women make a likability trade off more then men. this manifests itself as women being forced to couch opinions when the same opinion can be vouched by men more aggressively and with more confidence. 

[[naming-is-hard]]. Feminism has (sometimes intentional on both sides) misconceptions about the superiority of women over men. Quick google for the definition 
> the advocacy of women's rights on the basis of the equality of the sexes.
Equality being the key word which I think most people agree with. Issue for most people against feminism is the prospect that there is an inequality to begin with I suppose. 

# feminism and mens rights activists
Feminism doesn’t exclude men’s issues per say. It’s about equality. Men are free to join together and voice their issues as well. 

The fact that men do not voice their issues is proof that men have the more beneficial position in life. This is muddied by the fact that one of the issues men deal with is not communicating their issues. Or maybe it’s compounded by increased sympathy for women aka damsel in distress which causes female issues to take more light. 


# Internet's Cultural Impact
In her essay about the internet it discusses how the internet is degrading culture, community and sense of identity. 
When I last referenced this topic I chose to expound on the internet's benefits through productivity and economy, although I ultimately concluded that those weren't necessarily good things. 
But that's not what the topic is about. It's more about the soul. So can I say that the internet has been good for people's sense of self, community and culture? The ability to find other's in your stupid niche circles. 

Stay connected with your friends across the country. [[focus-on-the-world-around-you]] argues that you should just forget about those friends and not know what they are doing lol. In the past when you didn't have a circle of friends you could turn to in real life you pretty much had to move to the city or something or accept your life of solitude. [[participate-in-communities]] is key to success. I know this to be true. 

The internet gives you options but there's also the argument against having an overabundance of options. 

# discords as community hubs
it all started with the halo days on those custom servers. I still think that was the epitome because it was so easy to create commmunities by hosting your own servers. people naturally congregated around the same servers and you actually got to know people and join clans. with a game as baseline as halo you even saw people develop playstyles. I remember bigzilla constantly grabbing the sniper, sticky rice doing some sneaky shit and myself gravitating to the banshee. those days were so much fun lol. the custom servers where you'd play zombies. playing with my brother and kevin. they still play together to this day in discords. that was probably the natural evolution of online gaming communities after after years of ranked online play. 

# deep work
Don’t complain about having more time do perform focus work if you aren’t effectively using your time at work. 

# LEVEL up YOUR LIFE 
lifting weights. Upgrade in real life. Similar to clothes. Lol. 

sketch idea: weight lifters as classes. novice, beginner, intermeddiate, advanced. 
would just draw normal class progressions but with visibly different body types. 

# phases in life 
You go through phases In life and that’s okay. You’ve taken long breaks from anime and re entered with a gusto. The same will probably happen again and you can still look back with fondness. Right now you are into filmmaking. 

# pantinas
repeated use. 
- carbon steel, cast iron
- leather
- raw denim

# always be optimizing
it's funny. I just read jia's essay on arguing maybe not against. but how society rallies individuals to optimize their life. to live with the system and synthesize with it and truly embody it. 

yet, that is exactly what I want to do. I want to be efficient. to be conventionally attractive. fit. well dressed. cultured. smart. funny. 

for others? for rena? my family and friends? random individuals on the internet? myself?

in today's society this inherently means [[optimizing-for-selfishness]] and thus becoming a more selfish individual yourself. 

biggest time wasters
- apex legends
- tiktok : )

I do want to add these things back in .... slowly. but I need to figure out my life first.
there's conceivably 8 hours in a work day in which I am forced in one spot. I can make the most of that. otherwise. 

there was a tiktok about skipping the phase of your life where you dating and figuring life out and going straight into the extravagent sunday brunch part of your life. 

okay so I get home at 5:30 ish. and I plan on getting into bed around 10. I don't wake up til like 8:20ish though... why do I need so much sleep. very inconvenient. but for now I get into bed at 10 and sleep around 10:30 that means I sleep like 10 hours... that's a lot. I use social media for a bit and then go to sleep. 

anyways that is like 4.5 hours I have a night to myself. I spend an hour eating and doing dinner. then another hour working out, showering and taking care of daily hygeine. 

# lack of energy 
- motivation?
- pure energy
- workout in the mornings?
- I think I sleep a lot
  - prioritize naps..

- Always do some physical fitness after dinner... aka dynamic stretch, ab work and stretch
- review my diet, stop eating shit food and focus on veggies, fruits and lean protein
- drink more fucking water 
- sleep is good
- I don't meditate
- put away my electronics, downstairs. I can only social media while I cook?

so there are definitely things I know I need to do that I am not doing yet... fuck. I am definitely not priotizing keystone habits.

I think my next book should be on this topic instead because I'm always fucking DEAD by the time I get home. : )
