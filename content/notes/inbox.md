# emotion battle system
I really liked the idea of multiple viewpoints existing in your head with Disco Elysium. One way I see this playing out in Reaper is letting emotions build up and unleashing them in attacks. Fuck I need an iPad to draw out what I am thinking... This is where the visuals come into play. The allegory is letting your emotions out vs bottling them up. Expressing yourself. 

attacks are different ways of manipulating emotions. making them pissed off. calming yourself down. then you can attack out of anger, alleviating yourself of that emotion. 

in traditional fights you will invade their mind directly and do a few things. 
- assess how they're feeling
- search for weak points 
- manipulate their emotions (make them angry, hit harder but less accurately)
  
then in real life you fight normally.
in reaper battles. other reapers will attempt to invade your mind as well. 

one day your target doesn't have too many descriptors. but one noticeable one is they have a lengthy coat which sei notices. 

during the battle she will invade both your minds. sei will have depressing thoughts. it doesn't matter. if we die we die. eji will attempt to rouse himself out more positively. I can do this. don't let her get to you. 

this reaper, ava, is someone you'll commonly have interactions with throughout the game. maybe they'll be like eji. someone who cares too much. is too passionate. 

eji struggles with mental battles but this represents a necessary turning point for him. 

another antagonistic reaper is your physical partner when you eventually take down sei. 
she openly yearns for the day she can take down sei. this is alluded to, that something like this happens and reapers can be targets until the midway battle when a reaper assaults your mind. 

sei's badge (a signature piece) becomes a dangly earring that eji wears after their battle. 
sei doesn't have a scythe (or equivilent weapon). you don't need it. 
sei's backstory is a lost love. he lived a good life. stoic mindset. they both died together. (or he died first and she found a new love) he waited for her but she never showed up. he waited for a long time. eventually he naturally forgot why he felt the way he did. one day someone offered him a coat and a job. he's someone who takes his responsibilities seriously. does the adult job. his story is that sometimes it doesn't matter. sometimes you'll just die full of regret. 

when you become a reaper you forget the reason you feel the way you do. all you have left are your emotions. eventually when your "responsibilities are absolved" so are your emotions. responsibilities being an allegory for passion or pupose in life. there's no more reason left to live. but are they being absolved? or is it just being left to others.

the missions play out relatively the same. it starts out with them just chatting at a coffee shop. discussing philosophy or whatever. they get texted their mission and then they're off. it's relatively hub based? it takes place in a big city so things are cramped. 

it comes in waves. emotions. you have to pass thresh holds and then things come crashing down all over you. like activating the next phase in a boss fight. the stages of grief
denial -> acceptance 

eji and sei are both hardworkers. eji is more callous though. youthful. brash. headstrong. he's like the sun. a big theme is their bond together. 

eji was a politician? popular? wanted to change the world.
eji's got an ottermode build. fairly lanky.

eji and sei's story is a personal one. a story about regret.

eji's story after sei is meant to be more about community. 

sei like's traditional first wave diner bitter coffee. eji has him try new third wave coffee. visibly makes a face "it's sour". it's not bad. it's just not coffee. 

sei: "did you have a girlfriend?"
eji: "lots of em"

sei is measured, composed. relaxed. flexibile. 

the first mission sees eji chasing something. running through an alleyway and get obscured by some buildings. camera pans up to the sky where sei is smoking. his smoke flows through the sky. r e a p e r appears over the moon. fades out.  fades back to eji. you fight some monsters. you fight a remixed monster that forces you to change your tactics. you fight a combination of both. you fight a boss that tests your understanding of the remix. but then there's a barrier. they're too resistent. that is when sei comes in and invades their mind. afterwords a small amount of exposition. the next day starts at the coffee shop where they chat until the target text comes in. and then they're off. 

artstyle can be a mix like omori. pixel art 2d overworld. hand drawn battle system. look to manhwas for character design. I really like the girl from that one bdsm manga. I want to model the antagonistic shinigami after her. 

like PT but instead of a traditional horror it's more of a surrealist existential horror. I'm going to do the same everything, everyday for the rest of my life until I die. is this what life is? so I was exploring this idea for my game but fuck it bro. 

atb battle system: real time action builds up an action bar where you enter their mind and inflict hell upon them. 


someone who's killed themselves but stayed behind. they wanted to end it all but they felt strongly enough that they stayed behind. a life without
