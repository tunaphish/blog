# biases
there are many biases to be aware of when you write, ponder, persuade. try to avoid (or abuse) these when going about your intellectual pursuits and knowledge work. 

survivorship bias
recency bias
easily retrievable bias
abstraction bias
exposure bias
tunnel effect


# cliques and exclusionary behavior as it relates to my team
> **clique**: a small group of people, with shared interests or other features in common, who spend time together and do not readily allow others to join them.

The important part is do not readily allow others to join them. 
The greater issue with cliques is making others to feel like outsiders. To not be a part of the clique is to suffer. 
Exclusionary behavior oftentimes comes up in my writing because I really like the idea of nobility and noble houses who often practice these sorts of things. 
Hereditary bloodlines that pass on leaders to the new rold 


# capitalism 
Capitalism assumes most efficient means of production is driven my human selfishness. That innovation is driven by that. I don’t believe that’s true. Money is influence and insteads launches wickedness to highest power. Game theory rewards selfish behavior. Selfish individuals get to the top.  Money is influence. Power over the world. Trite statements. 

Capitalism. Promotes inequality. Which stifles innovation from particular flavor of capitalism. Economics are a moving spectrum. Same with politics. It’s the sliding window of acceptable policy. 

Efficient means of product was best way to propogate humanity. Now it’s not. Fucking the world.

# work effort theory in corporations
This theory applies to office workers where they do not have equity in the company. 
Why invest yourself so much where you won’t benefit. The idea is work hard get promoted and that is where you see benefit. Is this the way it plays out though? Is it really worth it?
It is inherently disproportionate the value you generate for a company vs your compensation. Why tip the scales even further but giving more of your time to a company?

The argument for why it's acceptable for a company to take more money is because they take on the risk. But that becomes unacceptable after a certain point. It's not a blank check. It's a sliding scale for more risk that you take on, the more cash you are entitled to. It is also not zero risk. You can lose your job at the whim of your employer.

The argument for software developers a lot of the time is just leave a company after a couple years and use lateral movement to move up. companies seem to reward this behavior as well with expiring bonuses.

# reconciling agile and long term planning
- have long term goals
- agile
  
I keep going between mapping a year to see where you could place yourself. And then just focusing on what you are going to do this week. 
The farther out you plan the more ambiguity there is. with literally everything. The things I wanted a year ago aren't the things I want now. 
Here I realized I don't know what agile actually means. it's just some nebulous term that people throw about to describe... idk it's really vague. 

# software development culture
encourages dispassionate feeling. logic. that's not what I want to be all the time even though that's my modus operandi.

- nofap how porn effects your brain
- Algorithms reinforcing your interests and likes. Presented as bad. As an echo chamber. Isn’t that different right from real life. If you think about a farmer constantly exposed to same thing over and over. It’s curation. Exposure bias says people tends towards things they see often. But things you see often is often a good indicator that it’s important. The best indicator that you’ll run into some situation is if you’ve run into that situation before. Its sort of like habits in that way. 
- Virtue signaling. Separate yourself from your work.

# feminism 
women make a likability trade off more then men be side of the expectation for women to be more submissive and less aggressive. 
[[naming-is-hard]]. Feminism has misconceptions about the superiority of women over men. Quick google for the definition 
> the advocacy of women's rights on the basis of the equality of the sexes.

Equality being the key word which I think most people agree with. Issue for most people against feminism is the prospect that there is an inequality to begin with I suppose.

Avoid hidden contracts in models, try to be as explicit as possible. counterpoint is logic changes obviously depend on model changes. what is a hidden contract. 
depends on client to do the right thing.

creating demos for all your work is an organic way of reviewing (retro) your work (content creation)

to reduce my analysis paralysis I want to just listen to experts but it's incompatible with how I am. I have to know why otherwise I can't bring myself to just do something. 

It appears I need 9hrs of sleep. If I sleep early enough to wake up before alarms it ranges from 8-9 hours. 

I should draw for my notes and whatever I am intersested in atm. 

set aside some time for these things.

if it's an issue, it'll come back up again

Internet provided an outlet for change without meaningfully effecting anything. Before you had to go somewhere and it effected meaningfully because it was local. 

Professional opinion havers. Aka influencers. Changing how you think. Changing your cognitive bias. 

Women have their pick of men. They want a good man. 

Biological instinct for men is to be with multiple women. Vs women to lock down one good man. 

Feminism doesn’t exclude men’s issues per say. It’s about equality. Men are free to join together and voice their issues as well. 

The fact that men do not voice their issues is proof that men have the more beneficial position in life. This is muddied by the fact that one of the issues men deal with is not communicating their issues. 

Or maybe it’s compounded by increased sympathy for women aka damsel in distress which causes female issues to take more light. 

Hypergamy. Friendship paradox.

When it comes to mental differences. Individuality varies so much that using sex or race as any kind of indicator makes no sense. But does it make sense when speaking in generalities and trends. That’s the argument the google manifesto guy was talking about. Cultural factors effect these things. The meme stat about black crime is often brought up outside of the context of increased policing in minority neighborhoods or the correlation between being poor and committing crime. But once we do away with those factors if there was just a difference in mental biology that pre determines behavior in certain ways that only manifests itself as trends and generalities. Do you police against that.  

Generalities play out that way but world is full of nuance and subtlety that it doesn’t fit. It’s the difference between theory and practice. The devil is in the details.

# joji yeah right - day in the life of a software developer who's languishing 

I'mma fuck up my life. I remember I had this idea a while. the song seems like it's talking about just self destructive hedonism. I focused on the fuck up my life part though. 

okay I just read the genius lyrics and he's talking about people who don't really vibe with each other and just hang out because... it's beneficial. the specific situation he was in was having a bunch of money and girls just dancing with him because of that but they don't fuck with him and he though, fuck it who cares. 

kind of like how a lot of people feel about their job. they don't care about the job. the mission. they out here trying to get paid. and in the end they engage with self destructive behavior. it's a pseudo vlog in this way. pseudo documentary. 

the fruitless effort of climbing the social ladder. of making more money. and not being any happier. 

thinly veiled sadness.
