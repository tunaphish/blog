# mens rights activists 
Feminism doesn’t exclude men’s issues per say. It’s about equality. Men are free to join together and voice their issues as well. 

The fact that men do not voice their issues is proof that men have the more beneficial position in life. This is muddied by the fact that one of the issues men deal with is not communicating their issues. Or maybe it’s compounded by increased sympathy for women aka damsel in distress which causes female issues to take more light. 

In any case, one tenet for [[maintaining-personal-relationships]] is to focus on one issue at a time. This means letting feminism focus their voice on women's issues. And creating your own community, events, and hubs for men's rights. 

# Internet's Cultural Impact
In her essay about the internet it discusses how the internet is degrading culture, community and sense of identity. 
When I last referenced this topic I chose to expound on the internet's benefits through productivity and economy, although I ultimately concluded that those weren't necessarily good things. 
But that's not what the topic is about. It's more about the soul. So can I say that the internet has been good for people's sense of self, community and culture? The ability to find other's in your stupid niche circles. 

Stay connected with your friends across the country. [[focus-on-the-world-around-you]] argues that you should just forget about those friends and not know what they are doing lol. In the past when you didn't have a circle of friends you could turn to in real life you pretty much had to move to the city or something or accept your life of solitude. [[participate-in-communities]] is key to success. I know this to be true. 

The internet gives you options but there's also the argument against having an overabundance of options. 


# trend towards temporal 
I am constantly thinking about having lasting things. how to make lasting happiness, lasting changes in my life, my life's work, accumulating skills over time. but I also need to accept that some things are just for a moment in time and that's okay. like the wedding. just a one day event that will come and go. but that's fine. 

# pantinas as social proof for hobbies
repeated use. 
- carbon steel, cast iron
- leather
- raw denim

# lack of energy 
- motivation?
- pure energy
- workout in the mornings?
- I think I sleep a lot
  - prioritize naps..

- Always do some physical fitness after dinner... aka dynamic stretch, ab work and stretch
- review my diet, stop eating shit food and focus on veggies, fruits and lean protein
- drink more fucking water 
- sleep is good
- I don't meditate
- put away my electronics, downstairs. I can only social media while I cook?

so there are definitely things I know I need to do that I am not doing yet... fuck. I am definitely not priotizing keystone habits.

I think my next book should be on this topic instead because I'm always fucking DEAD by the time I get home. : )

# overengineering 
finally getting to code again. it hasn't been the most glamourous tasks but I'm getting the job done. struggling through the population orchestrator I'm realizing that overengineering is the greater sin rather then underengineering. you have all these code paths that at the moment do anything and make everyday coding tasks harder as you try to wrap your head around what everything does. it trades making short term code changes a little harder everyday vs the hope that it will make a big change in the future a lot easier. 

as you gain in seniority you generally have an idea of where to make these choices, it's a necessary skill because when you don't make it correctly it's very painful. 

there was also the incident where I felt first hand why immutability was important. there was a piece of state being passed around that kep track of all the running network calls and so some slipped my notice because that state was being amended in other classes. not fun. 

# wedding woes
rena is so excited for our wedding. I am as well... but not nearly as much as she is. today we got news that some multi million dollar company dropped fat stacks on our venue so we're being booted. nothing is going to change that fact. 

I'm okay but she's taking it pretty hard. 

It is both a blessing and a curse to feel things so deeply. 

# apex ledge ends
spent hours and hours playing this god forsaken game. and for what. I yell. scream. have fun. in ways that I don't really do in my normal life. I don't get that kind hype and freedom from going to shows. or other real life events haaa. guess I really am just a gamer at heart. it's so hard to reconcile how much time I spend on the game versus all the other things I want to do in my life though. Even now I'm itching to get a few rounds in. it's just apex legends in general though that sucks me in like this. I replayed BoTW and started disco elysium and they just weren't pulling me in the same way. it was my thesis before about making a competitive shooter into a roguelite, two very gamey games that I absolutely love.
