# life tenets
1. "you have to start romanticizing your life"
2. [[keystone-habits]] > Events > Project Work

# minimalism tenets
1. you should never be able to say "I forgot I had this". What's the point of having it then. Either discard it or place it somewhere where you will be able to get it when you need it. 
2. your posessions should 'spark joy'
3. focus on what matters (essentialism), not having less

# mental models for video game development
the split between client and back end was made somewhat easier in my mind. what is something's responsiblity. where do I draw the lines. in back end everything is just logic based. I only have to think about things on what axis. with front end I struggled a bit more although I didn't know why. With video game development is similar. Learning more about front end dev paradigms is helping with this a bit. It's easier to envision how things are encapsulated (it's components).

# accepting that you can do anything. but you won't do everything
every door you open closes another door. as I continue down this corporate path we're seeing others live out our dreams. there's the longing, coffee shop. the potion shop game I thought about. watching them live out their dreams. risking a lively hood. 

Now I do believe in myself. A lot of it is prioritizing what you actually want out of life. Dylan's text reminded me of this. Choosing where you want to spend your limited time. I want to spend it with family and loved ones. I just hate phone calls lol. I need to call my mom. But other then that working on projects I care about. Sharing with the world the messages that I think are truly important. Helping the people around me. I don't really care as much about proving myself at work right now. I've proved myself. Helping others and lifting them up. I want that to be my focus right now. 

I have people to take care of. But I'm at the apex of maslow's hierarchy. self actualization. What are you willing to sacrifice in order to move faster? I'm actually pretty efficient at my job. I'm willing to sacrifice some time here in order to keep moving forward in my own projects. I don't have a lot of friends but that's okay? right. and if I combine some of my socializition with routines it's fine right. 


# clear your mind (inbox zero)
In the morning I strive to get working on my knowledge work as fast as possible so the actual routine is fairly minimal. Some hygiene for myself and the dogs and coffee then it's a short walk to the office. Then it's a few exercises to clear my mind like [[inbox-zero]] and morning papers. After that I eat the frog and focus on design work if possible. I try to figure out what decisions I need to make throughout the day and make those decisions, this generally  means that design work (the hardest work) is done in the morning. these tasks are generally punctuated using pomodoro's. the break time should be used to address whatever was my biggest distraction from getting into [[flow-state]]. sometimes this is my lower back pain so I'll do a few stretches. other times it's my need to socialize so I'll play with the dog or chat with my coworkers. . sometimes it's just a general lack of focus. of which can usually be cleared with some meditation. 

# training inputs
[[do-not-touch-your-mouse]] ... another idea for some dexterity work but just a good way of increasing your flow state. a good idea for a video! there's even a website for it. video starts off with me standing up and throwing my mouse straight in the trash. I'll even have an after credits scene where I dig my mouse out of the trash because you need your mouse at least some of the time. one of the biggest ones would probably be how to navigate safari with just my keyboard. another fun experiment would be doing my morning papers through dictation instead of physically typing it myself. I think the biggest issue would be creating links though actually. I never noticed but this intellij isn't just for spelling. It is actually suggesting markdown shortcuts which is pretty cool. 

I have lots of stray thoughts throughout the day that I'd like to record. wonder what would be the mechanism for that. Generally I want to use these morning sessions to do so but lightning strikes at odd times. 


videos are good because they emphasize other skills that I lack. like speaking or conveying espression. things of that nature. 



# art in the constellations
Connecting ideas to make concentrations.  Like Korean fashion reapers... connecting concentrations to other concentrations. Concepts to other concepts. Stories to other stories. Mechanics to other mechanics.  Coffee shop. New wave coffee vs old wave coffee. Conversations in there.  Nihilism vs... not nihilism. Sei breaks their spirit. Eli encourages them to move on. Live a life with no regrets. In comparison the work I’m doing right now feels really dry. How do you exhibit this kind of enthusiasm for bullshit...  I kind of want to cruise right now. 

applying smart note taking to creative work. There’s two parts. Generating ideas. Mechanical work. The mechanics follow from the idea. The message. Kind of like [[baushaus]]. Form follows function. In this case the form is the concentration. Aka reaper daddies. 

System for managing resources. Ingredients get delivered. Fresh ones go bad. You have to preserve which lowers their usefulness or changes it.  Some rare ingredients to bad after a day. You concoct potions from them. Rarer potions require a bunch of rare items delivered at once. You can supplement buy buying specialty ingredients but it’s expensive. 

Gather ideas in one place. Connecting them in novel ways. Let them produce ideas for you. Gather the best ideas from games you played. Stories you read visuals from movies. The coolest scene from moody was stabbing in the background. but it also allows you to develop ideas in parallel. This means you have multiple projects cooking. But like academic work there’s mechanical steps that need to be done. Instead of rearranging ideas and deleting redundant sentences. You are filming shots. Or you are drawing some lines.  Remember the Pareto principal for short films is the strength of the script. It can apply again to mechanical work but it’s like 80 percent of the 20 percent. Numbers may be off but the point is some things are higher Impact. 

Morning papers should last until the stream ends. Then focus on editing your thoughts. This also means your sprint system might go out of date? Then what do you do films on... well it comes as a result of exocortex right? There needs to be something external to the exocortex guiding practical work. He probably talks about this later on actually. 



# willpower vs focusing on work that energizes you, grit
I wonder if it's a folly to try and break my life into sprints and instead put my focus onto things where my focus lies. I should probably read the rest of the book though. reading the book has been really inspiring. having this "slip box" of ideas to dump into. connecting them. letting grow and come together gels exactly with how I work. the challenge comes from converting this for creative pursuits. 

my take with how this progresses for practical project is there's an external system. but it sounds like you need to be comfortable picking up and dropping things. which makes it a bit difficult as I want to start pumping out projects. maybe projects should be smaller in scope? especially video games? sprints could probably be consolidated down to one week even. let's see what the rest of the book has to say. 

as I read about more and more productivity systems it, I start agreeing with bruce lee's take more. things will naturally jump out at you based on where you are on life and that's okay. 


# environmental design
creating a space for your endeavors is so important... 
recognizing those spaces is important too


# flow state as a developer

##front end developer

Supplemented research in the mornings

# disco elysium
it's incredibly interesting. there's a lot of foreign systems right now. but the different internal archetypes are really cool. different views of the world firing and giving you different contextual information. 
it mimics real life. there are different voices in your head that notices different things that collide, conflict with each other. Not every viewpoint is dominant at all stages of your life. 


# curator's job
a museum curator's job is to craft a narrative to convey the message they are trying to convey they will draft a passage to frame the visitor's thoughts. then they will thoughtfully arrange a variety of pieces, from one or multiple artists that support this story. sometimes a piece will have additional supporting information. if there is still something missing sometimes they will commission artists to supplement the exhibition.

# imposter syndrome
Imposter syndrome happens for me quite often on things that are fairly open in the public mind. Things like food taste or video skills. In contrast with software engineering where I feel I have a pretty firm grasp on things and it doesn't really exist to the public, I don't have the irrational thought that someone will call me out for my lack of knowledge.

But with things like filmmaking or art where everyone has an opinion on those things, it feels a lot harder to put myself out there. 

# fiction > non fiction 
This is another way that fiction tends to be greater than non fiction. Is the breadth that it can reach. Although I've argued you should favor depth over breadth many times, it's undeniable that you reach far more people with your philsophical thoughts in a game like Nier Automata vs Thus Spoke Zarathustra. 

Is that actually true though? Nier Automata will stay in the public conscious for maybe a decade but once it's no longer supported it's difficult, the graphics get too bad then the amount of people will generally stop playing it. This is somewhat difficult to judge because video games are a medium in their infancy vs the rich history of written text. 

# Discourse with others
although the slipbox is great for discourse with yourself, discourse with others is invaluable for generating new opinions and fresh ideas. Also books fulfill this purpose but they cannot speak back and follow thought trains to completion like a conversation can. 

# emotion battle system
I really liked the idea of multiple viewpoints existing in your head with Disco Elysium. One way I see this playing out in Reaper is letting emotions build up and unleashing them in attacks. Fuck I need an iPad to draw out what I am thinking... This is where the visuals come into play. The allegory is letting your emotions out vs bottling them up. Expressing yourself. 

attacks are different ways of manipulating emotions. making them pissed off. calming yourself down. then you can attack out of anger, alleviating yourself of that emotion. 

in traditional fights you will invade their mind directly and do a few things. 
- assess how they're feeling
- search for weak points 
- manipulate their emotions (make them angry, hit harder but less accurately)
  
then in real life you fight normally.
in reaper battles. other reapers will attempt to invade your mind as well. 

one day your target doesn't have too many descriptors. but one noticeable one is they have a lengthy coat which sei notices. 

during the battle she will invade both your minds. sei will have depressing thoughts. it doesn't matter. if we die we die. eji will attempt to rouse himself out more positively. I can do this. don't let her get to you. 

this reaper, ava, is someone you'll commonly have interactions with throughout the game. maybe they'll be like eji. someone who cares too much. is too passionate. 

eji struggles with mental battles but this represents a necessary turning point for him. 

another antagonistic reaper is your physical partner when you eventually take down sei. 
she openly yearns for the day she can take down sei. this is alluded to, that something like this happens and reapers can be targets until the midway battle when a reaper assaults your mind. 

sei's badge (a signature piece) becomes a dangly earring that eji wears after their battle. 
sei doesn't have a scythe (or equivilent weapon). you don't need it. 
sei's backstory is a lost love. he lived a good life. stoic mindset. they both died together. (or he died first and she found a new love) he waited for her but she never showed up. he waited for a long time. eventually he naturally forgot why he felt the way he did. one day someone offered him a coat and a job. he's someone who takes his responsibilities seriously. does the adult job. his story is that sometimes it doesn't matter. sometimes you'll just die full of regret. 

when you become a reaper you forget the reason you feel the way you do. all you have left are your emotions. eventually when your "responsibilities are absolved" so are your emotions. responsibilities being an allegory for passion or pupose in life. there's no more reason left to live. but are they being absolved? or is it just being left to others.

the missions play out relatively the same. it starts out with them just chatting at a coffee shop. discussing philosophy or whatever. they get texted their mission and then they're off. it's relatively hub based? it takes place in a big city so things are cramped. 

it comes in waves. emotions. you have to pass thresh holds and then things come crashing down all over you. like activating the next phase in a boss fight. the stages of grief
denial -> acceptance 

eji and sei are both hardworkers. eji is more callous though. youthful. brash. headstrong. he's like the sun. a big theme is their bond together. 

eji was a politician? popular? wanted to change the world.
eji's got an ottermode build. fairly lanky.

eji and sei's story is a personal one. a story about regret.

eji's story after sei is meant to be more about community. 

sei like's traditional first wave diner bitter coffee. eji has him try new third wave coffee. visibly makes a face "it's sour". it's not bad. it's just not coffee. 

sei: "did you have a girlfriend?"
eji: "lots of em"

sei is measured, composed. relaxed. flexibile. 

the first mission sees eji chasing something. running through an alleyway and get obscured by some buildings. camera pans up to the sky where sei is smoking. his smoke flows through the sky. r e a p e r appears over the moon. fades out.  fades back to eji. you fight some monsters. you fight a remixed monster that forces you to change your tactics. you fight a combination of both. you fight a boss that tests your understanding of the remix. but then there's a barrier. they're too resistent. that is when sei comes in and invades their mind. afterwords a small amount of exposition. the next day starts at the coffee shop where they chat until the target text comes in. and then they're off. 

artstyle can be a mix like omori. pixel art 2d overworld. hand drawn battle system. look to manhwas for character design. I really like the girl from that one bdsm manga. I want to model the antagonistic shinigami after her. 

# jumping in and out of projects
need low iteration cycles that allow progress that shift with your whims... but also need to reduce the cost of starting up as much as possible as well. clear instructions on how to get started again. 

# building a second brain
as much as I love the ideas in the lecture I can't really implement them myself. In order to learn something you have to interact with it deeply and just reading someone else's infographic doesn't do it. you have to make the infographic yourself. come to the same conclusions. not only that but the processes seem so overwhelming. it kind of makes me think about my own processes for things and if I am overthinking things. building up these processes and habits over time makes more sense though... I needed my ipad. keep forgetting to grab it for these writing sessions. especially since I want more visuals. 

# my dreams
dream one: working on a creative project with a cool team. being dedicated to a project. throwing my all at it. staying up late. continuing to craft it and love it. 

dream two: owning a shop and living above it. I always imagine it being relatively low cost of living. 

could they be combined? just being an old dude behind the register with his love for things? maybe it's a coffee shop. so it's a coffee shop where I sell a bunch of cool stuff too. art. come downstairs from the second story. make coffee for my regulars. tend to my collectables of cool stuff. It's more of a casual hobby for me. ceramics. serving good food on beautiful pieces of ceramics and also selling things for local artists. hanging out with my regulars. working on my own stuff during periods of downtime. closing up shop early (around 3pm because it is a coffeeshop after) heading up and continuing to work on stuff. my dogs just hang out and rena's doing her own thang. 

a place for creatives. people come in and ideate. share ideas. work on the screenplays, art. setup marketplaces on the walls. idk about that actually. I'd want it to be a curated space. Crafted to how I'd like it to be. And I have particular tastes. 

> walt disney: we don't make movies to make money. we make money to make movies. 

# walking down an endless hallway
like PT but instead of a traditional horror it's more of a surrealist existential horror. I'm going to do the same everything, everyday for the rest of my life until I die. is this what life is? so I was exploring this idea for my game but fuck it bro. I really deal with this in real life [[seek-work-that-energizes-you]] REMEMBER this lol

# atb battle system
real time action builds up an action bar where you enter their mind and inflict hell upon them. 

# am I too happy?
sometimes I feel like I was a lot more creative as a kid. you could attribute it to a lack of inhibitions but I also think it was just the fact that I didn't have life quite as figured out as I do now. I'm pretty happy. Relaxed. Nothing really gets to me anymore. Nice for maturity but maybe not that good for art lol. 

but I want to be the sun. 
manbuns are in again. I want to grow out my hair. 
I'm just not someone who enjoys speed

# good days
sometimes I'll have random good days and I'm not sure where they are coming from. but I didn't use to feel like this or at least I haven't felt like this in a long time. just a general feeling welling in my chest that everything is good. I'm even tired right now yet I still feel that way. Interested in trying to make this more of a regular thing. I think working out is a big part of that. 

but do I workout in the morning or night. nights are the definitive boost to my productivity. I'm able to eek out a few more cycles at night this way. but physical health is more important then anything. if you find that you are sacrificing meals or working out for anything else then you need to reevaluate your priorities.

# my friday nights
 are my fridays sacred? to be honest I really didn't want to sacrifice my spa night (the best part of my week) but obviously events are more important but spa night is an event. a conundrum. as I make my schedule I do realize my time is limited. I don't have infinite time. as hard as it is I do think I want to delete apex legends

# finding community
I want to join more communities. meet more people. it's so hard for me... and I can't really do it over online things. I say I don't want to meet software devs. but amazon workers are fine? and the ones showing up to art events generally aren't devs. they're ux designers and business peeps. 

# deliberate practice for knowledge work
to mindfully practice an art. forces you to become aware of your flaws insteadly of mindlessly repeating them. useful for training fundamentals.
a flaw of [[habit-chain]]s is that they innately ask you to perform a task mindlessly. that's what gives them value. however, for work that you are actively trying to improve you need to deliberately practice.
