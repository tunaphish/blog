# scope of work
I should probably limit personal projects at work to an hour or two. I still need to succeed at my job and it's a little too much hubris to assume I can just spend half my time doing other stuff. 

I've also done a surprisingly good job of phasing out my mindless internet use... I wonder what happened. Do I feel any different? I have that time period after work for some mindless tiktoks... but other than that. 

As for that tiktok time I'm not feeling particularly inspired by it anymore. Maybe it's the fact that I can't get very invested in such a short format. Is there any off the top of my head that I still think about. 

I should take those things that bianca sent seriously. Plus put more of an effort into my friendships with the people at work.

# random topics
avoid weasal words. assert your opinion
Survivorship bias
Restrict volatility on things that don’t matter. This is where experience comes in handy. You can tell what doesn’t matter.

# apologies
the desire to apologize comes from my desire to be forgiven rather then my desire to find peace in the individual you are apologizing to. 
finding peace within yourself is fine. you should seek to do. but acknowledge that fact and don't shroud it in the idea that you are doing so for the well being. 
Practically, this means allowing that individual to be angry at you 

Limit arguments to the topic at hand (don't bring up past grievances, you had your opportunity and chose not to)
  you can use them as counter examples. 
Validate feelings


- your initial point was the team should have more empathy. I think you were referring to getting donunted three days in a row. But from my perspective I did that. I finished my doc. Saw an opportunity to donut you. Realized you took a call in the middle of standup and decided to let it go. And you yelled at me like a child regardless. 
- you do childish shit all the time and I don't care (you said you are trying to fit in... but in the current social dynamic it's pretty clear that you are an active partcipant), granted this time you were going through something but I wasn't aware of that. 
- you even agreed that's not how you speak to people from the alexa example  yet you popped off in the same way
- what you did was worse, you've acknowledged it. But do you really think so. The bulk of our conversation is surrounding the donuting. (this may not be true) he was outlaying his feelings leading up to his pop off which is still about the pop off. Will let t his slide. 


remember to feel things fully. embrace it. and then let it go.
