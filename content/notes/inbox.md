# biases
there are many biases to be aware of when you write, ponder, persuade. try to avoid (or abuse) these when going about your intellectual pursuits and knowledge work. 

survivorship bias
recency bias
easily retrievable bias
abstraction bias
exposure bias
tunnel effect


# cliques and exclusionary behavior as it relates to my team
> **clique**: a small group of people, with shared interests or other features in common, who spend time together and do not readily allow others to join them.

The important part is do not readily allow others to join them. 
The greater issue with cliques is making others to feel like outsiders. To not be a part of the clique is to suffer. 
Exclusionary behavior oftentimes comes up in my writing because I really like the idea of nobility and noble houses who often practice these sorts of things. 
Hereditary bloodlines that pass on leaders to the new rold 


# capitalism 
Capitalism assumes most efficient means of production is driven my human selfishness. That innovation is driven by that. I don’t believe that’s true. Money is influence and insteads launches wickedness to highest power. Game theory rewards selfish behavior. Selfish individuals get to the top.  Money is influence. Power over the world. Trite statements. 

Capitalism. Promotes inequality. Which stifles innovation from particular flavor of capitalism. Economics are a moving spectrum. Same with politics. It’s the sliding window of acceptable policy. 

Efficient means of product was best way to propogate humanity. Now it’s not. Fucking the world.

# work effort theory in corporations
This theory applies to office workers where they do not have equity in the company. 
Why invest yourself so much where you won’t benefit. The idea is work hard get promoted and that is where you see benefit. Is this the way it plays out though? Is it really worth it?
It is inherently disproportionate the value you generate for a company vs your compensation. Why tip the scales even further but giving more of your time to a company?

The argument for why it's acceptable for a company to take more money is because they take on the risk. But that becomes unacceptable after a certain point. It's not a blank check. It's a sliding scale for more risk that you take on, the more cash you are entitled to. It is also not zero risk. You can lose your job at the whim of your employer.

The argument for software developers a lot of the time is just leave a company after a couple years and use lateral movement to move up. companies seem to reward this behavior as well with expiring bonuses.

# reconciling agile and long term planning
- have long term goals
- agile
  
I keep going between mapping a year to see where you could place yourself. And then just focusing on what you are going to do this week. 
The farther out you plan the more ambiguity there is. with literally everything. The things I wanted a year ago aren't the things I want now. 
Here I realized I don't know what agile actually means. it's just some nebulous term that people throw about to describe... idk it's really vague. 

## follow your interests, follow motivation
Idea proposed by smart notes that discusses organically following your interests and allowing them to build up and dictate your project plan instead of following a rigid plan from the get. 

Similar to how agile works I think? The idea being that you don't know what customers want so you develop the most important thing now, gather feedback and then move onto the next important thing that was dictated by that feedback and the cycle begins anew. 

However, does this contrast with the idea of [[deep-work-habit-chain]] that proposes you spend a long time focusing on one thing at a time. Maybe not. You are performing work deeply. Just over long time periods. You'll drop it and come back to it again. Smart notes proposes that good ideas take time to build up over the course of months or years. And that by steadily growing ideas and coming back to them organically through connections you are able to actually bring them to a satisfying conclusion. Aligns with [[habit-chain]]s as well.

- nofap how porn effects your brain
- Algorithms reinforcing your interests and likes. Presented as bad. As an echo chamber. Isn’t that different right from real life. If you think about a farmer constantly exposed to same thing over and over. It’s curation. Exposure bias says people tends towards things they see often. But things you see often is often a good indicator that it’s important. The best indicator that you’ll run into some situation is if you’ve run into that situation before. Its sort of like habits in that way. 
- Virtue signaling. Separate yourself from your work.

# feminism 
women make a likability trade off more then men be side of the expectation for women to be more submissive and less aggressive. 
[[naming-is-hard]]. Feminism has misconceptions about the superiority of women over men. Quick google for the definition 
> the advocacy of women's rights on the basis of the equality of the sexes.

Equality being the key word which I think most people agree with. Issue for most people against feminism is the prospect that there is an inequality to begin with I suppose.

Avoid hidden contracts in models, try to be as explicit as possible. counterpoint is logic changes obviously depend on model changes. what is a hidden contract. 
depends on client to do the right thing.

creating demos for all your work is an organic way of reviewing (retro) your work (content creation)

to reduce my analysis paralysis I want to just listen to experts but it's incompatible with how I am. I have to know why otherwise I can't bring myself to just do something. 

It appears I need 9hrs of sleep. If I sleep early enough to wake up before alarms it ranges from 8-9 hours. 

I should draw for my notes and whatever I am intersested in atm. 

set aside some time for these things.

if it's an issue, it'll come back up again
