# biases
there are many biases to be aware of when you write, ponder, persuade. try to avoid (or abuse) these when going about your intellectual pursuits and knowledge work. 

survivorship bias
recency bias
easily retrievable bias
abstraction bias
exposure bias
tunnel effect


# cliques and exclusionary behavior as it relates to my team
> **clique**: a small group of people, with shared interests or other features in common, who spend time together and do not readily allow others to join them.

The important part is do not readily allow others to join them. 
The greater issue with cliques is making others to feel like outsiders. To not be a part of the clique is to suffer. 
Exclusionary behavior oftentimes comes up in my writing because I really like the idea of nobility and noble houses who often practice these sorts of things. 
Hereditary bloodlines that pass on leaders to the new rold 


# Capitalism : ) 
Capitalism assumes most efficient means of production is driven my human selfishness. That innovation is driven by that. 
I don’t believe that’s true. Money is influence and insteads launches wickedness to highest power. Game theory rewards selfish behavior. Selfish individuals get to the top.  Money is influence. Power over the world. Trite statements. 
Capitalism. Promotes inequality. Which stifles innovation from particular flavor of capitalism. Economics are a moving spectrum. Same with politics. It’s the sliding window of acceptable policy. 
Efficient means of product was best way to prop rotate humanity. Now it’s not. Fucking the world.

# work effort theory
Why invest yourself so much where you won’t benefit. The office theory of Jim’s and Dwights and Michaels.  

# reconciling agile and long term planning
I keep going between mapping a year to see where you could place yourself. And then just focusing on what you are going to do this week. 

The farther out you plan the more ambiguity there is.. with literally everything. The things I wanted a year ago aren't the things I want now. 


# fitness
do I have a spot for fitness? 
I keep going between mapping a year to see where you could place yourself. And then just focusing on what you are going to do this week. 
As egotistical as it is. You have to establish ethos. Social capitol before stepping out of the lines. That means actually being fit. 

# giving up game development
I struggle to decide between what I perceive to be two artistic sides of myself. I want to acquire true master. But to do so you need focus. But a little bit of everything a day?  
Eventually you would be a savant. 
Each day a narrative. 
Everyday week a project. 
Live your life a day at a time. 

I think I can do it all. Including art. If I specifically give up the dream of being an indie dev. I reach base level of competency over time with an hour or so dedicated to each individual activity… except game development. There’s just such breadth of specific skills you need that only apply to game development that require a base level of competency to make something anywhere near decent. I would need to sacrifice everything else. To do truly deep work. And I just can’t do that. But if I think about art. Just art. I can still manage it and live the other life I want to live. And I do want to live that life.  I’ve toyed with the idea for so long. And I know I’ll revisit it again in the future.   But for now. It’s not a path I can pursue. It’s not what makes my life worth living honestly. That’s not me talking myself out of a dream. It’s addressing all the other sides of myself that have their own wants and desires. So I’ll quiet this side of myself. For now. A good time period. I’ll grieve that side of me. And I’ll let it go. For myself. 

Understanding the time required, what I'd need to put into it to succeed. To truly be a solo developer.

# fundamentals
The better your aim is. The riskier play you can make and come out on top. Lower skill players have to play differently. 

# naming is hard

# follow your interests
Idea proposed by smart notes that discusses organically following your interests and allowing them to build up and dictate your project plan instead of following a rigid plan from the get. 

Similar to how agile works I think? The idea being that you don't know what customers want so you develop the most important thing now, gather feedback and then move onto the next important thing that was dictated by that feedback and the cycle begins anew. 

However, does this contrast with the idea of [[deep-work-habit-chain]] that proposes you spend a long time focusing on one thing at a time. Maybe not. You are performing work deeply. Just over long time periods. You'll drop it and come back to it again. Smart notes proposes that good ideas take time to build up over the course of months or years. And that by steadily growing ideas and coming back to them organically through connections you are able to actually bring them to a satisfying conclusion. Aligns with [[habit-chain]]s as well.

nofap how porn effects your brain

women make a likability trade off more then men be side of the expectation for women to be more submissive and less aggressive. 

Algorithms reinforcing your interests and likes. Presented as bad. As an echo chamber. Isn’t that different right from real life. If you think about a farmer constantly exposed to same thing over and over. It’s curation. Exposure bias says people tends towards things they see often. But things you see often is often a good indicator that it’s important. The best indicator that you’ll run into some situation is if you’ve run into that situation before. Its sort of like habits in that way. 

Virtue signaling. Separate yourself from your work.

# jeff nippard's framework for achieving body recomposition
1. Recognize training is the driving force!
2. Decide on a primary goal (build muscle or lose fat?)
3. Center calories around MAINTAINENCE
4. Set up macro targets (start with protein!)
5. Pay attention to details (OPTIMIZE!)

# sliding model for protein consumption
High Body Fat (1.2 g/lb) <-----> Low Bodyfat (1.6 g/lb)

# Recomp Supplements
Ordered according to most useful for resistance training
1. protein powder | creatine | caffeine
2. multivitamins | fish oil
