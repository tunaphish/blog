# capitalism 
Capitalism assumes most efficient means of production is driven my human selfishness. That innovation is driven by that. I don’t believe that’s true. Money is influence and insteads launches wickedness to highest power. Game theory rewards selfish behavior. Selfish individuals get to the top.  Money is influence. Power over the world. Trite statements. 

Capitalism. Promotes inequality. Which stifles innovation from particular flavor of capitalism. Economics are a moving spectrum. Same with politics. It’s the sliding window of acceptable policy. 

Efficient means of product was best way to propogate humanity. Now it’s not. Fucking the world.

## maliciousness rises to the top
I haven't found a good allegory for this yet. This theory was presented to me by my I think world economics professor in college and for some reason it has always stuck with me. Basically when you get to the higher echelons in the world then everyone around you is an exceptional person. Generally, they are smart, capable, charismatic individuals for them to have made it this far. At that point, there's one pillar left to ascend and that is your willingness to hurt others for personal gain. That's the last one and why evil inviduals always ascend to the top. 

# feminism 
setting and meeting expectations is incredibly important. in the world of work that manifests itself as the tenet of **underestimate, overdeliver**. A boss would rather the employee who estimates average output and delivers outputs instead of the employee who estimates perfect output and delivers great output. the second employee performed more but did not meet expectations. this is where biases hurt women in the workplace. Because the perceived bias for women is to be likeable, warm, and friendly; women make a likability trade off more then men. this manifests itself as women being forced to couch opinions when the same opinion can be vouched by men more aggressively and with more confidence. 

[[naming-is-hard]]. Feminism has (sometimes intentional on both sides) misconceptions about the superiority of women over men. Quick google for the definition 
> the advocacy of women's rights on the basis of the equality of the sexes.
Equality being the key word which I think most people agree with. Issue for most people against feminism is the prospect that there is an inequality to begin with I suppose. 

# feminism and mens rights activists
Feminism doesn’t exclude men’s issues per say. It’s about equality. Men are free to join together and voice their issues as well. 

The fact that men do not voice their issues is proof that men have the more beneficial position in life. This is muddied by the fact that one of the issues men deal with is not communicating their issues. Or maybe it’s compounded by increased sympathy for women aka damsel in distress which causes female issues to take more light. 

# inviduals over trends
When it comes to mental differences. Individuality varies so much that using sex or race as any kind of indicator makes no sense. But does it make sense when speaking in generalities and trends. That’s the argument the google manifesto guy was talking about. Cultural factors effect these things. The meme stat about black crime is often brought up outside of the context of increased policing in minority neighborhoods or the correlation between being poor and committing crime. But once we do away with those factors if there was just a difference in mental biology that pre determines behavior in certain ways that only manifests itself as trends and generalities. Do you police against that.  


# project timelines
don't focus too much on videos right now?

- focus on personal habits right now (creative works and projects since that's the side of myself I want to develop right now ASSTHETICS)
    - bring art into the real world somehow
- after I move focus on environmental design starting with kitchen, workspace and bedroom?
- finally focus on others, hosting events, hanging with people socially, friends, dogs, rena, family

# Random Thoughts
watching a coworker walk into work now. everyone's got their own habits. their own little worlds they are drifting through. 

I originally thought I didn't like people who were deeply cynical. I think that's changed though. It's moreso people who use sarcasm to put down people's attempt at being authentic. Jia is a deeply cynical writer, aimed at society and herself as an active participant in society. Her examples are so detailed that they feel aimed at specific individuals, again likely a result of her self deprecating cynicism. So while offputting at first I can better understand it. 

In her essay about the internet it discusses how the internet is degrading culture, community and sense of identity. 

When I last referenced this topic I chose to expound on the internet's benefits through productivity and economy, although I ultimately concluded that those weren't necessarily good things. 

But that's not what the topic is about. It's more about the soul. So can I say that the internet has been good for people's sense of self, community and culture? The ability to find other's in your stupid niche circles. 

Stay connected with your friends across the country. [[focus-on-the-world-around-you]] argues that you should just forget about those friends and not know what they are doing lol. In the past when you didn't have a circle of friends you could turn to in real life you pretty much had to move to the city or something or accept your life of solitude. [[participate-in-communities]] is key to success. I know this to be true. 

The internet gives you options but there's also the argument against having an overabundance of options. 

Clusters should naturally form around specific topics. Right now I'm researching how to make better line art ala korean tattoo artists. I could render that way. And do my typical subject of anime women. hmm. Instead this turned out to be apex 

# launch
nothing in particular. I haven't coded in a month which I consider to be my core competency at my job so maybe I should be looking for more opportunities to code. but god damn does refactoring suck ass lol. iterative improvement. now I know why people just leave a project after it launches. cuz maintainence isn't fun. 

I think understanding project lifecycles is important though and walking through software from the start to the end would be good experience... but code often lives in live for decades... I ain't about to do that. I just really don't want to be touching antonio's stuff.

WET and DRY. WET and DRY. YAGNI. I try to keep these in mind when coding so I can focus on delivery. when code is written correctly in the first place it isn't amazingly difficult to get it going in the first place. 

# consider predicate classes for overly complicated
when will this class change. it changes for one reason. and that one reason is isolated to this one class. 

# my history with competitive shooters
it all started with the halo days on those custom servers. I still think that was the epitome because it was so easy to create commmunities by hosting your own servers. people naturally congregated around the same servers and you actually got to know people and join clans. with a game as baseline as halo you even saw people develop playstyles. I remember bigzilla constantly grabbing the sniper, sticky rice doing some sneaky shit and myself gravitating to the banshee. those days were so much fun lol. the custom servers where you'd play zombies. playing with my brother and kevin. they still play together to this day in discords. that was probably the natural evolution of online gaming communities after after years of ranked online play. 

after that I'd get on and off again addicted to online shooters. halo 3. modern warfare 2. team fortress 2. overwatch. now apex legends. 

I was pretty proud of hitting diamond in overwatch with my pharah.dva play. 

apex legends is hitting me particularly hard. nowadays I'll play online for hours at a time after I get home. And I'll fooking love it. 

battle royales really appeal to that dopamine high hit though. I forget what study it was exactly but the one where they describe how you can't regularly give a reward. You have to give it out almost randomly. and a fifty percent win rate in 1:1 games is I think too regular. 

battle royales also provide multiple playstyles. the goal is to be the last team standing and fighting is tertiary to that goal (although the primary factor for fun in my opinion)

# sustained aggression in apex legends and why I sucked so far
common advice in battle royales is defensive play is the way to get more wins. the reason for this is the goal is to win, not get kills. however, there's some nuance to apex legends that makes this a little different. 

## lack of loot
loot disparity isn't so big a factor in apex that you'll live or die but your drops (except for your guns). however, over time though this will trend your wins in a certain direction. my rule of thumb currently is that if you don't have a red shield by end game then you were not aggressive enough. 

## third parties
a common rule of thumb for apex is that a fight is lasting more then half to a full minute then you need to leave. the reason for this is third parties. the takeaway for most people is that you should be disengaging from a lot of fights. but what I've noticed from many pro players, is that fights will finish relatively quickly because they push hard even on what seems like minor advantages. the counterpoint is that they can push on minor advantages because their aim will save them though. 

## waiting for the right moment
don't wait for the right moment. dive dive dive. the longer you wait the more third parties will come and you need to close out fights if you are third partying. 

## pushing on less resources
this is something I struggle with a lot. but if I have less health my inclination is always to reset. however, this isn't the beat that I always need to follow. reloads are huge in apex and if you can push during an enemy reload then you can almost always secure a down. 

## my playstyle history
overwatch. I could spam rockets with pharah. pop in for a kill and burst out. 
tf2. I could burst with scout and then dip and heal. I definitely like guerilla gameplay.

the issue is you need to secure kills in apex. this is reflected by the fact that I can get downs or decent dmg but my kills lag. 

apex legends requires you to have sustained aggression. knock someone, secure the kill. or heal close enough that you can prevent a res from happening. 

I spent entirely way too long talking about apex legends lol. 

# battle royales are an multiplayer roguelike
similar to why rougelikes are pretty addicting. in fact they have a lot similar. the random loot drops. rare win occurences. randomziation in general actually. skill based gameplay. loot progression. 

I wonder if there is a game idea there that leans more into the roguelike experience. a bunch of parties spawn in a dungeon and are trying to explore and claim the loot faster then the other teams. but you can actively engage and fight the other teams as well (to your own detriment).


# diversity in friend groups
in a place like downtown seattle dominated by men. You HAVE to go where women congregate if you actually want any semblance of balance.
