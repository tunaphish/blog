# scope of work
I should probably limit personal projects at work to an hour or two. I still need to succeed at my job and it's a little too much hubris to assume I can just spend half my time doing other stuff. 

I've also done a surprisingly good job of phasing out my mindless internet use... I wonder what happened. Do I feel any different? I have that time period after work for some mindless tiktoks... but other than that. 

As for that tiktok time I'm not feeling particularly inspired by it anymore. Maybe it's the fact that I can't get very invested in such a short format. Is there any off the top of my head that I still think about. 

I should take those things that bianca sent seriously. Plus put more of an effort into my friendships with the people at work.
