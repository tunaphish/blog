# capitalism 
Capitalism assumes most efficient means of production is driven my human selfishness. That innovation is driven by that. I don’t believe that’s true. Money is influence and insteads launches wickedness to highest power. Game theory rewards selfish behavior. Selfish individuals get to the top.  Money is influence. Power over the world. Trite statements. 

Capitalism. Promotes inequality. Which stifles innovation from particular flavor of capitalism. Economics are a moving spectrum. Same with politics. It’s the sliding window of acceptable policy. 

Efficient means of product was best way to propogate humanity. Now it’s not. Fucking the world.

## maliciousness rises to the top
I haven't found a good allegory for this yet. This theory was presented to me by my I think world economics professor in college and for some reason it has always stuck with me. Basically when you get to the higher echelons in the world then everyone around you is an exceptional person. Generally, they are smart, capable, charismatic individuals for them to have made it this far. At that point, there's one pillar left to ascend and that is your willingness to hurt others for personal gain. That's the last one and why evil inviduals always ascend to the top. 

# reconciling agile and long term planning
- have long term goals
- agile
  
I keep going between mapping a year to see where you could place yourself. And then just focusing on what you are going to do this week. 
The farther out you plan the more ambiguity there is. with literally everything. The things I wanted a year ago aren't the things I want now. 
Here I realized I don't know what agile actually means. it's just some nebulous term that people throw about to describe... idk it's really vague. 

# feminism 
setting and meeting expectations is incredibly important. in the world of work that manifests itself as the tenet of **underestimate, overdeliver**. A boss would rather the employee who estimates average output and delivers outputs instead of the employee who estimates perfect output and delivers great output. the second employee performed more but did not meet expectations. this is where biases hurt women in the workplace. Because the perceived bias for women is to be likeable, warm, and friendly; women make a likability trade off more then men. this manifests itself as women being forced to couch opinions when the same opinion can be vouched by men more aggressively and with more confidence. 

[[naming-is-hard]]. Feminism has (sometimes intentional on both sides) misconceptions about the superiority of women over men. Quick google for the definition 
> the advocacy of women's rights on the basis of the equality of the sexes.
Equality being the key word which I think most people agree with. Issue for most people against feminism is the prospect that there is an inequality to begin with I suppose. 

# feminism and mens rights activists
Feminism doesn’t exclude men’s issues per say. It’s about equality. Men are free to join together and voice their issues as well. 

The fact that men do not voice their issues is proof that men have the more beneficial position in life. This is muddied by the fact that one of the issues men deal with is not communicating their issues. Or maybe it’s compounded by increased sympathy for women aka damsel in distress which causes female issues to take more light. 


# male culture
encourages dispassionate feeling. logic. that's not what I want to be all the time even though that's my modus operandi. 

there's a sense of superiority in male dominated spaces (reddit, development) about transcending popular culture. things like not giving a shit about your appearance. how you come across to other people. ignoring feelings. 

men latched onto "acting homo" with their buddies because it's one of the only ways to display genuine affection for your friends without sacrificing traditional masculinity. [[allow-yourself-to-be-vulnerable]] and just tell him he has a nice dick. 


# inviduals over trends
When it comes to mental differences. Individuality varies so much that using sex or race as any kind of indicator makes no sense. But does it make sense when speaking in generalities and trends. That’s the argument the google manifesto guy was talking about. Cultural factors effect these things. The meme stat about black crime is often brought up outside of the context of increased policing in minority neighborhoods or the correlation between being poor and committing crime. But once we do away with those factors if there was just a difference in mental biology that pre determines behavior in certain ways that only manifests itself as trends and generalities. Do you police against that.  


# project timelines
don't focus too much on videos right now?

- focus on personal habits right now (creative works and projects since that's the side of myself I want to develop right now ASSTHETICS)
    - bring art into the real world somehow
- after I move focus on environmental design starting with kitchen, workspace and bedroom?
- finally focus on others, hosting events, hanging with people socially, friends, dogs, rena, family

# Random Thoughts
watching a coworker walk into work now. everyone's got their own habits. their own little worlds they are drifting through. 

I originally thought I didn't like people who were deeply cynical. I think that's changed though. It's moreso people who use sarcasm to put down people's attempt at being authentic. Jia is a deeply cynical writer, aimed at society and herself as an active participant in society. Her examples are so detailed that they feel aimed at specific individuals, again likely a result of her self deprecating cynicism. So while offputting at first I can better understand it. 

In her essay about the internet it discusses how the internet is degrading culture, community and sense of identity. 

When I last referenced this topic I chose to expound on the internet's benefits through productivity and economy, although I ultimately concluded that those weren't necessarily good things. 

But that's not what the topic is about. It's more about the soul. So can I say that the internet has been good for people's sense of self, community and culture? The ability to find other's in your stupid niche circles. 

Stay connected with your friends across the country. [[focus-on-the-world-around-you]] argues that you should just forget about those friends and not know what they are doing lol. In the past when you didn't have a circle of friends you could turn to in real life you pretty much had to move to the city or something or accept your life of solitude. [[participate-in-communities]] is key to success. I know this to be true. 

The internet gives you options but there's also the argument against having an overabundance of options. 

I myself have never made any authentic friendships over the internet but... for lack of trying. I know Rena definitely has and maintains some of them to this day, some even going to her bachelorette party. 


Clusters should naturally form around specific topics. Right now I'm researching how to make better line art ala korean tattoo artists. I could render that way. And do my typical subject of anime women. hmm.
