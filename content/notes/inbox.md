1. [[metacognition]] requires cleanup
2. the most interesting media explores questions that don't have a defined answer and the author doesn't necessarily attempt to impose one. thought explorations
3. Planned spontaneity (concept I think about a lot)

# books are ineffective mediums for transferring knowledge
this is because they rely on "transmissionism" to convey information. author has knowledge. author writes that knowledge in a book. audience reads the book. audience gains the author's knowledge. this is obviously not how knowledge transfer works. 

> you have to actively engage in material to understand it. 
it ignores the way people understand and learn. 
1. emotions (the enthusiasm from a good professor, a fiction book conveying philosophy through tragic prose about human stories)
2. creative projects
3. active engagement
4. visuals
5. exploration (testing boundaries of ideas, disagreeing with it, synthesizing it, relating to other material, derive new ideas)
6. recall and spacing

exocortex has a somewhat organic way of training spacing and recall outside of SRS. if you are able to make a connection back to a topic that you haven't thought about in a while that's a form of recall and strengthing the connection. 


this means two things
1. having a better understanding of how you learn [[metacognition]]
2. there is room for exploring mediums that align with how humans understand 
   1. [[the-advantages-of-videogames-as-a-medium]] align with some of these learning models although videogames rarely convey information in this way because for the most part they are designed for entertainment first. 


# Using drugs to enhance creative endeavors.
1. 5-6-21 I was using edibles quite a bit this weekend and it really felt like it fueled my creative pursuits a lot. I had bursts of inspiration that I haven't had in a while for reaper and I was flying through thoughts that I've had in my mind for a long time and connecting ideas. 
2. some recent research I did into microdosing seems to support what I've been feeling. Maybe I can chat with zach a bit about this.

## writing engineering strategy

strategies and visions are concise documents that guide decision making (tenets) for teams, align priority. necessary when the same conversations keep getting rehashed or it is unclear what tech investments should be made. basically when future ambiguity gets in the way of execution for teams today

> people often conflate strategy with innovation. good strategy is boring though.

## the process

1. take five designs
2. consolidate similarities into a strategies
3. take five strategies
4. consolidate strategies into a vision

tip for design is to keep crafting your problem statement until your solution is clear
