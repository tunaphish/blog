# biases
there are many biases to be aware of when you write, ponder, persuade. try to avoid (or abuse) these when going about your intellectual pursuits and knowledge work. 

survivorship bias
recency bias
easily retrievable bias
abstraction bias
exposure bias
tunnel effect


# capitalism 
Capitalism assumes most efficient means of production is driven my human selfishness. That innovation is driven by that. I don’t believe that’s true. Money is influence and insteads launches wickedness to highest power. Game theory rewards selfish behavior. Selfish individuals get to the top.  Money is influence. Power over the world. Trite statements. 

Capitalism. Promotes inequality. Which stifles innovation from particular flavor of capitalism. Economics are a moving spectrum. Same with politics. It’s the sliding window of acceptable policy. 

Efficient means of product was best way to propogate humanity. Now it’s not. Fucking the world.

## maliciousness rises to the top
I haven't found a good allegory for this yet. This theory was presented to me by my I think world economics professor in college and for some reason it has always stuck with me. Basically when you get to the higher echelons in the world then everyone around you is an exceptional person. Generally, they are smart, capable, charismatic individuals for them to have made it this far. At that point, there's one pillar left to ascend and that is your willingness to hurt others for personal gain. That's the last one and why evil inviduals always ascend to the top. 


# reconciling agile and long term planning
- have long term goals
- agile
  
I keep going between mapping a year to see where you could place yourself. And then just focusing on what you are going to do this week. 
The farther out you plan the more ambiguity there is. with literally everything. The things I wanted a year ago aren't the things I want now. 
Here I realized I don't know what agile actually means. it's just some nebulous term that people throw about to describe... idk it's really vague. 



# argument against exposure|recency bias
Algorithms reinforcing your interests and likes. Presented as bad. As an echo chamber. Isn’t that different right from real life. If you think about a farmer constantly exposed to same thing over and over. It’s curation. Exposure bias says people tends towards things they see often. But things you see often is often a good indicator that it’s important. The best indicator that you’ll run into some situation is if you’ve run into that situation before. Its sort of like habits in that way. 

# feminism 
setting and meeting expectations is incredibly important. in the world of work that manifests itself as the tenet of **underestimate, overdeliver**. A boss would rather the employee who estimates average output and delivers outputs instead of the employee who estimates perfect output and delivers great output. the second employee performed more but did not meet expectations. this is where biases hurt women in the workplace. Because the perceived bias for women is to be likeable, warm, and friendly; women make a likability trade off more then men. this manifests itself as women being forced to couch opinions when the same opinion can be vouched by men more aggressively and with more confidence. 

[[naming-is-hard]]. Feminism has (sometimes intentional on both sides) misconceptions about the superiority of women over men. Quick google for the definition 
> the advocacy of women's rights on the basis of the equality of the sexes.
Equality being the key word which I think most people agree with. Issue for most people against feminism is the prospect that there is an inequality to begin with I suppose. 

Feminism doesn’t exclude men’s issues per say. It’s about equality. Men are free to join together and voice their issues as well. 

The fact that men do not voice their issues is proof that men have the more beneficial position in life. This is muddied by the fact that one of the issues men deal with is not communicating their issues. Or maybe it’s compounded by increased sympathy for women aka damsel in distress which causes female issues to take more light. 

## male culture
encourages dispassionate feeling. logic. that's not what I want to be all the time even though that's my modus operandi. 

there's a sense of superiority in male dominated spaces (reddit, development) about transcending popular culture. things like not giving a shit about your appearance. how you come across to other people. ignoring feelings. 

men latched onto "acting homo" with their buddies because it's one of the only ways to display genuine affection for your friends without sacrificing traditional masculinity. [[allow-yourself-to-be-vulnerable]] and just tell him he has a nice dick. 


# hypergamy (incel theory)
Women have their pick of men. They want a good man. Biological instinct for men is to be with multiple women. Vs women to lock down one good man. 

This is similar to the friendship paradox about why it seems like all your friends have more friends then you but all your friends friends also have more friends then them. It's because there's a few individuals with a crazy high amount of friends who are friends with all your friends. 

That's the explanation given by incels about the large sex disparity in men. There's a few high quality men who make up the bulk of sexual partners for women whereas all the rest of the men just don't have sex. 

The argument against this is that it's a nice idea in theory but lots and lots of nuance and other competing factors and theories in the world don't make this a reality. [[strive-for-ideals-operate-practically]] put in another way (although I wouldn't say this is something to strive for). It just explains why while it sounds like a good theory it doesn't exactly play out that way in real life.

# racism and statistics
When it comes to mental differences. Individuality varies so much that using sex or race as any kind of indicator makes no sense. But does it make sense when speaking in generalities and trends. That’s the argument the google manifesto guy was talking about. Cultural factors effect these things. The meme stat about black crime is often brought up outside of the context of increased policing in minority neighborhoods or the correlation between being poor and committing crime. But once we do away with those factors if there was just a difference in mental biology that pre determines behavior in certain ways that only manifests itself as trends and generalities. Do you police against that.  


# connecting creative work with each other
Last is tiktok that mostly inspries me to be beautiful... Maybe not just me but my life which I really like and think I need. Although effectively I end up standing around just staring at tiktok for an hour so is that really the best way to do that?

There's this idea that social media is bad because it exaggerates the life of those around you. People post their highlight reals having you think it's the real thing. Romanticising your life.. Means that you do it too. You feed into that cycle.

I think there is room for both? Avoiding the highlight real but accepting the boringness of life. Romanticize your boring life. Because those are the things that matter. Being in the moment and appreciating each day by day. Each breath. Each moment. I think that's the way to go. 

# yesterday
- Don't speak to them. You don't know them. 
- You've never seen it before. Yet. Something about it is familliar. 
  

  # what am I doing with my life?

  launch is going right now and I've just been laser focused on that. And then when I get home I'm pretty mentally drained from work so I just want to full send on apex the entire day.

  Last week I did very pooly on my habits. Didn't work out as much. Didn't do my morning paper sessions. Tiktok all night. I was also a bit frustrated by my partner and her realistic dreams. 

  Jia's always be optimizing essay reinforces the slow intentional living that I have gained a better appreciation for. Doing the same things everyday. Being with the same people. Some find that to be a prison. I find it to be incredibly freeing to focus on what matters. Finding the extraordinary in the ordinary. 

  I've read passages like these before and they really just fly over your head unless you are in the right headspace for it to really resonate with you. People change over time. The value in reengaging in a piece of media. Like the classic 500 Days of Summer example. Time to process ideas. Passages. How they relate to eachother. 

  I was really frustrated with my partner last night and this morning. Still dealing with the fallout of a mistake I made a long time ago. Time heals all wounds? Feels like we should be past this now. The gaps between her bringing this up keep getting longer and longer but this onew as so severe. Granted she's hormonal right now but it's so frustrating to have this be thrown in my face. Granted she has insecurities. Our life is so good now though. Blegh.
