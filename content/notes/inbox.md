# Planned Spontonaiety
A principle I've seen a lot. This is important for creative work that focuses on... being creative. Following insights and connections as they inspire and lead you somewhere. How do you enforce rigid structure and self discipline on something that is inherently inspiration based. You have a structure that plans for spontonaeity and rewards it. 

- timeblocking: planning for flexibility. things will crop up last minute. 
- vacations: have a framework. some idea of what you want to do. some must hits. but then go with the flow. 
- creative work: sit down and write from your constellation but don't force it?



# if everything is meaningful then nothing is
This is okay. Not every piece of your wardrobe should be a statement piece. The rest of your outfit is meant to complement that statement piece. Pareto principle. 

# building anticipation
Somethings are meant to build anticipation. And then paying off that antcipation. 

Suspense movies are like this. Jump scares are oftentimes derided but if there's nothing that ever shocks you then the tension building doesn't ever really amount to anything does it? It's made scarier because you are anticipating something. Sometimes the scariest scenes don't come from horror movies. Parasite was so good at this when the poor family was stuck inside the rich family's house. audiences only remembers peaks and valleys. so while they'll struggle to remember the scenes leading up to these tense ones, the tense ones are burned forever in their mind. 

People, balk at having a scheduled love making session. However, because it's something that is scheduled, you are looking forward to it. Anticipating it. This is antithetical to spontaneous sex that people generally seem to favor and pervades media because media portrays new love and not old love. Considered unromantic and unsexy. Counterpoint is that with spontaneous sex is similar to my jump scare argument. You still anticipate spontaneous sex with the added benefit that you don't know when it's coming which increases the tension. 



# using digital constellation for inspiration 
I really love these fantasy playlists. The person is posting their universe. The associated drawing. A playlist with it. Everything's just... chill. So yeah I do think there's room for more creative elements in this space. It feels like a tool dominated by academics and programmers. Philosophy. So while those subjects do interest me. I want this to be a place where I make creative connections as well you know. 


# yesterday's suntime funtime.
Yesterday was a blast though. A bunch of people came to the office and had an amazing time. In the morning we played with the dogs, got poke and took a long lunch by the spheres and then just relaxed in the afternoon. Feeling pretty recharged honestly. **I really enjoy eating outside by the spheres.** I think that's one takeaway is that I'm going to consistently head out there for some suntime. Maybe I'll take bear with me as well. Hope Rena can eventually compound her breaks and she can come meet me by the spheres to grab something to eating

jas, krushi and tadeo should be coming around today so that'll be fun.

# warmth in space
space has a strong association with cold tones for good reason. deep, nebulous vacuum void of space. However, the way I wanted to trend my life. the colors I've been attaching myself to have been warm. I think there's a real void in my life for that kind of stuff. I'm closer to a Type A person. Fairly logically minded, in a software engineering position surrounded by that type. Just want to be a more well rounded person. anyways this was a long winded way of saying I wanted the theming to convey more warmth and be more inviting. 

# sacrificing unique vision for impact 
the power an individual can achieve pales in comparison to what an organization can achieve. the trade off is aligning those worldviews and sacrificing your unique vision. how does this scale up to a mega conglomerate like Amazon? each individual voice is lost in a sea of others but there's some guiding vision. some shared worldview all pushing us in the same direction? enacting an enormous prescence on the world. 

# acquiring depth at the expense of exposure
I thought a lot about whether or not I'd invest time into learning how to rock climb. today we're supposed to ride go karts. That lead me to think about how we've been doing a lot of like (fun but random activities). Fun for fun's sake is fine but it made me think about caleb's chat about exposure and time which is a rehash of the [[favor-depth-of-experience-over-breadth]] argument. he had another take that I hadn't considered but it was just opportunity cost. I guess this only applies to certain things but at any point you can drop something and get more exposure somewhere else. but that means you have to invest that time again if you want to acquire a similar level of depth there. 

# abundance mentality | growth mentality | truly believing in myself 
before getting this job at Amazon I didn't believe in myself. I didn't realize I didn't believe in myself either. I'm not sure how to explain it but I was somewhat resigned to certain tracts in life. I truly thought that some paths in life weren't available to me. Obviously I'm never going to be an NBA player but that doesn't mean I can't achieve what I want to achieve. 

Now I do believe in myself. A lot of it is prioritizing what you actually want out of life. Dylan's text reminded me of this. Choosing where you want to spend your limited time. I want to spend it with family and loved ones. I just hate phone calls lol. I need to call my mom. But other then that working on projects I care about. Sharing with the world the messages that I think are truly important. Helping the people around me. I don't really care as much about proving myself at work right now. I've proved myself. Helping others and lifting them up. I want that to be my focus right now. 

# eventually right not always right
The most misunderstood Amazon leadership principle is "is usually right." At first glance this is the surface level meeting. That they are always right. They come into meetings trying to convince everyone of their way of thinking. Always pushing back. Forcing others to submit by sheer will instead of working together to form a shared vision. 

My interpretation is the saying should be are eventually right. Good leaders arrive at the right answer, maybe not right away but with time. This manifests by meeting everyone's needs. Making little bets (small iteration cycles). Keeping doors open until they truly need to close them. 


# clear your mind (inbox zero)
In the morning I strive to get working on my knowledge work as fast as possible so the actual routine is fairly minimal. Some hygiene for myself and the dogs and coffee then it's a short walk to the office. Then it's a few exercises to clear my mind like [[inbox-zero]] and morning papers. After that I eat the frog and focus on design work if possible. I try to figure out what decisions I need to make throughout the day and make those decisions, this generally  means that design work (the hardest work) is done in the morning. these tasks are generally punctuated using pomodoro's. the break time should be used to address whatever was my biggest distraction from getting into [[flow-state]]. sometimes this is my lower back pain so I'll do a few stretches. other times it's my need to socialize so I'll play with the dog or chat with my coworkers. . sometimes it's just a general lack of focus. of which can usually be cleared with some meditation. 

# training inputs
[[do-not-touch-your-mouse]] ... another idea for some dexterity work but just a good way of increasing your flow state. a good idea for a video! there's even a website for it. video starts off with me standing up and throwing my mouse straight in the trash. I'll even have an after credits scene where I dig my mouse out of the trash because you need your mouse at least some of the time. one of the biggest ones would probably be how to navigate safari with just my keyboard. another fun experiment would be doing my morning papers through dictation instead of physically typing it myself. I think the biggest issue would be creating links though actually. I never noticed but this intellij isn't just for spelling. It is actually suggesting markdown shortcuts which is pretty cool. 

I have lots of stray thoughts throughout the day that I'd like to record. wonder what would be the mechanism for that. Generally I want to use these morning sessions to do so but lightning strikes at odd times. 

# knowledge training fundamentals
what would be considered fundamentals for knowledge work. when can I do this too. might be a good way of kicking off my mechanical work session. these are the kinds of skills I want to keep fresh in my mind. another video idea. training fundamentals for knowledge work and developing an SRS system from my exocortex (constellations). 
1. recall
2. problem decomposition (leetcode? are they fundamentals) TDD : )


another reason why reddit sucks. second hand opinions. try to focus on primary sources. not secondary sources. aka take the facts and come to your own observations. stop basing your opinions on other people's opinions. don't let other people tell you how to feel. (for research... not when chatting or things of that nature)

these notes rarely reflect my final or even my actual thoughts. some may be contradictory to what I think. however, to fully empower this method of notetaking I need to be able to link ideas, reconcile conflicting ideas or even discredit some of them. 

videos are good because they emphasize other skills that I lack. like speaking or conveying espression. things of that nature. 

# my priorities
Meds over events over project work

# art in the constellations
Connecting ideas to make concentrations.  Like Korean fashion reapers... connecting concentrations to other concentrations. Concepts to other concepts. Stories to other stories. Mechanics to other mechanics.  Coffee shop. New wave coffee vs old wave coffee. Conversations in there.  Nihilism vs... not nihilism. Sei breaks their spirit. Eli encourages them to move on. Live a life with no regrets. In comparison the work I’m doing right now feels really dry. How do you exhibit this kind of enthusiasm for bullshit...  I kind of want to cruise right now. 

applying smart note taking to creative work. There’s two parts. Generating ideas. Mechanical work. The mechanics follow from the idea. The message. Kind of like [[baushaus]]. Form follows function. In this case the form is the concentration. Aka reaper daddies. 

System for managing resources. Ingredients get delivered. Fresh ones go bad. You have to preserve which lowers their usefulness or changes it.  Some rare ingredients to bad after a day. You concoct potions from them. Rarer potions require a bunch of rare items delivered at once. You can supplement buy buying specialty ingredients but it’s expensive. 

Gather ideas in one place. Connecting them in novel ways. Let them produce ideas for you. Gather the best ideas from games you played. Stories you read visuals from movies. The coolest scene from moody was stabbing in the background. but it also allows you to develop ideas in parallel. This means you have multiple projects cooking. But like academic work there’s mechanical steps that need to be done. Instead of rearranging ideas and deleting redundant sentences. You are filming shots. Or you are drawing some lines.  Remember the Pareto principal for short films is the strength of the script. It can apply again to mechanical work but it’s like 80 percent of the 20 percent. Numbers may be off but the point is some things are higher Impact. 

Morning papers should last until the stream ends. Then focus on editing your thoughts. This also means your sprint system might go out of date? Then what do you do films on... well it comes as a result of exocortex right? There needs to be something external to the exocortex guiding practical work. He probably talks about this later on actually. 

Line thickness is a practical specific thing. Your exocortex needs to be conceptual and general.

# willpower vs focusing on work that energizes you, grit
I wonder if it's a folly to try and break my life into sprints and instead put my focus onto things where my focus lies. I should probably read the rest of the book though. reading the book has been really inspiring. having this "slip box" of ideas to dump into. connecting them. letting throw grow and come together gels exactly with how I work. the challenge comes from converting this for creative pursuits. 

my take with how this progresses for practical project is there's an external system. but it sounds like you need to be comfortable picking up and dropping things. which makes it a bit difficult as I want to start pumping out projects. maybe projects should be smaller in scope? especially video games? sprints could probably be consolidated down to one week even. let's see what the rest of the book has to say. 

as I read about more and more productivity systems it, I start agreeing with bruce lee's take more. things will naturally jump out at you based on where you are on life and that's okay. 


I had all these game ideas over the years that I sort of just forgot about. I attached gameplay and styles together. but what if that isn't necessarily what I wanted to do. what if I just had the random stylistic ideas. then random game ideas. scene ideas. and then craft a game out of all those things later... I'm getting really ambitious again when I don't even draw currently so maybe let's focus on this ideating phase right now. 

# environmental design
creating a space for your endeavors is so important... 
recognizing those spaces is important too


# flow state

## flow state as a front end developer
atoms → pages system
identify volatility, identify generality

## flow state as a back end developer
Separate view from logic...  
Encapsulation

Supplemented research in the mornings

# disco elysium
it's incredibly interesting. there's a lot of foreign systems right now. but the different internal archetypes are really cool. different views of the world firing and giving you different contextual information. 
it mimics real life. there are different voices in your head that notices different things that collide, conflict with each other. Not every viewpoint is dominant at all stages of your life. 


# curator's job
a museum curator's job is to craft a narrative to convey the message they are trying to convey they will draft a passage to frame the visitor's thoughts. then they will thoughtfully arrange a variety of pieces, from one or multiple artists that support this story. sometimes a piece will have additional supporting information. if there is still something missing sometimes they will commission artists to supplement the exhibition.

# natural clusters in constellations 
Because your mind tends to always come back to the same subject by following your interest it’s a lot easier to keep up with motivation(something I struggle with). Notes naturally tend to cluster around those interests and because your zettlekesten is permanent you are always contributing and furthering something. 

By following your interest you are prioritizing work that energizes you. 

Find short iteration and feedback cycles.  

Writing note on your understanding of text

Writing notes on your understanding of your own ideas. How supported they are. If there are any inconsistencies or repetition. 


# favor depth over breadth
everyday I do the same thing over and over. repetition is to be celebrated. it's the only way to achieve depth or anything meaningful in society. 

the common advice for software developers online is around a few years, start looking for a new job. that is because it's the fastest way for you to accelerate your paycheck.

# imposter syndrome
Imposter syndrome happens for me quite often on things that are fairly open in the public mind. Things like food taste or video skills. In contrast with software engineering where I feel I have a pretty firm grasp on things and it doesn't really exist to the public, I don't have the irrational thought that someone will call me out for my lack of knowledge.

But with things like filmmaking or art where everyone has an opinion on those things, it feels a lot harder to put myself out there. 

This is another way that fiction tends to be greater than non fiction. Is the breadth that it can reach. Although I've argued you should favor depth over breadth many times, it's undeniable that you reach far more people with your philsophical thoughts in a game like Nier Automata vs Thus Spoke Zarathustra. 

Is that actually true though? Nier Automata will stay in the public conscious for maybe a decade but once it's no longer supported it's difficult, the graphics get too bad then the amount of people will generally stop playing it. This is somewhat difficult to judge because video games are a medium in their infancy vs the rich history of written text. 

# Discourse with others
although the slipbox is great for discourse with yourself, discourse with others is invaluable for generating new opinions and fresh ideas. Also books fulfill this purpose but they cannot speak back and follow thought trains to completion like a conversation can. 

# emotion battle system
I really liked the idea of multiple viewpoints existing in your head with Disco Elysium. One way I see this playing out in Reaper is letting emotions build up and unleashing them in attacks. Fuck I need an iPad to draw out what I am thinking... This is where the visuals come into play. The allegory is letting your emotions out vs bottling them up. Expressing yourself. 

attacks are different ways of manipulating emotions. making them pissed off. calming yourself down. then you can attack out of anger, alleviating yourself of that emotion. 

in traditional fights you will invade their mind directly and do a few things. 
- assess how they're feeling
- search for weak points 
- manipulate their emotions (make them angry, hit harder but less accurately)
  
then in real life you fight normally.
in reaper battles. other reapers will attempt to invade your mind as well. 

one day your target doesn't have too many descriptors. but one noticeable one is they have a lengthy coat which sei notices. 

during the battle she will invade both your minds. sei will have depressing thoughts. it doesn't matter. if we die we die. eji will attempt to rouse himself out more positively. I can do this. don't let her get to you. 

this reaper, ava, is someone you'll commonly have interactions with throughout the game. maybe they'll be like eji. someone who cares too much. is too passionate. 

eji struggles with mental battles but this represents a necessary turning point for him. 

another antagonistic reaper is your physical partner when you eventually take down sei. 
she openly yearns for the day she can take down sei. this is alluded to, that something like this happens and reapers can be targets until the midway battle when a reaper assaults your mind. 

sei's badge (a signature piece) becomes a dangly earring that eji wears after their battle. 
sei doesn't have a scythe (or equivilent weapon). you don't need it. 
sei's backstory is a lost love. he lived a good life. stoic mindset. they both died together. (or he died first and she found a new love) he waited for her but she never showed up. he waited for a long time. eventually he naturally forgot why he felt the way he did. one day someone offered him a coat and a job. he's someone who takes his responsibilities seriously. does the adult job. his story is that sometimes it doesn't matter. sometimes you'll just die full of regret. 

when you become a reaper you forget the reason you feel the way you do. all you have left are your emotions. eventually when your "responsibilities are absolved" so are your emotions. responsibilities being an allegory for passion or pupose in life. there's no more reason left to live. but are they being absolved? or is it just being left to others.

the missions play out relatively the same. it starts out with them just chatting at a coffee shop. discussing philosophy or whatever. they get texted their mission and then they're off. it's relatively hub based? it takes place in a big city so things are cramped. 

it comes in waves. emotions. you have to pass thresh holds and then things come crashing down all over you. like activating the next phase in a boss fight. the stages of grief
denial -> acceptance 

eji and sei are both hardworkers. eji is more callous though. youthful. brash. headstrong. he's like the sun. a big theme is their bond together. 

eji was a politician? popular? wanted to change the world.
eji's got an ottermode build. fairly lanky.

eji and sei's story is a personal one. a story about regret.

eji's story after sei is meant to be more about community. 

sei like's traditional first wave diner bitter coffee. eji has him try new third wave coffee. visibly makes a face "it's sour". it's not bad. it's just not coffee. 

sei: "did you have a girlfriend?"
eji: "lots of em"

sei is measured, composed. relaxed. flexibile. 

the first mission sees eji chasing something. running through an alleyway and get obscured by some buildings. camera pans up to the sky where sei is smoking. his smoke flows through the sky. r e a p e r appears over the moon. fades out.  fades back to eji. you fight some monsters. you fight a remixed monster that forces you to change your tactics. you fight a combination of both. you fight a boss that tests your understanding of the remix. but then there's a barrier. they're too resistent. that is when sei comes in and invades their mind. afterwords a small amount of exposition. the next day starts at the coffee shop where they chat until the target text comes in. and then they're off. 

artstyle can be a mix like omori. pixel art 2d overworld. hand drawn battle system. look to manhwas for character design. I really like the girl from that one bdsm manga. I want to model the antagonistic shinigami after her. 

# jumping in and out of projects
need low iteration cycles that allow progress that shift with your whims... but also need to reduce the cost of starting up as much as possible as well. clear instructions on how to get started again. 


# handling apex
the days are flying by. I should just play apex during events because there isn't a whole lot going for me right now. unless I get the chance to play with harls and ryon. 

# horror
I really don't like horror or gratuitious depections of horror. The images from midsommar continue to live in my mind and I can't get them out. Keep thinking about it. But I guess it's really making a lasting impression huh

# building a second brain
as much as I love the ideas in the lecture I can't really implement them myself. In order to learn something you have to interact with it deeply and just reading someone else's infographic doesn't do it. you have to make the infographic yourself. come to the same conclusions. not only that but the processes seem so overwhelming. it kind of makes me think about my own processes for things and if I am overthinking things. building up these processes and habits over time makes more sense though... I needed my ipad. keep forgetting to grab it for these writing sessions. especially since I want more visuals. 

# keshi's music
light, relaxing. melancholic. 

# dylan's text
every door you open closes another door. as I continue down this corporate path we're seeing others live out our dreams. there's the longing, coffee shop. the potion shop game I thought about. watching them live out their dreams. risking a lively hood. 

I have people to take care of. But I'm at the apex of maslow's hierarchy. self actualization. What are you willing to sacrifice in order to move faster? I'm actually pretty efficient at my job. I'm willing to sacrifice some time here in order to keep moving forward in my own projects. I don't have a lot of friends but that's okay? right. and if I combine some of my socializition with routines it's fine right. 

# my dreams
dream one: working on a creative project with a cool team. being dedicated to a project. throwing my all at it. staying up late. continuing to craft it and love it. 

dream two: owning a shop and living above it. I always imagine it being relatively low cost of living. 

could they be combined? just being an old dude behind the register with his love for things? maybe it's a coffee shop. so it's a coffee shop where I sell a bunch of cool stuff too. art. come downstairs from the second story. make coffee for my regulars. tend to my collectables of cool stuff. It's more of a casual hobby for me. ceramics. serving good food on beautiful pieces of ceramics and also selling things for local artists. hanging out with my regulars. working on my own stuff during periods of downtime. closing up shop early (around 3pm because it is a coffeeshop after) heading up and continuing to work on stuff. my dogs just hang out and rena's doing her own thang. 

a place for creatives. people come in and ideate. share ideas. work on the screenplays, art. setup marketplaces on the walls. idk about that actually. I'd want it to be a curated space. Crafted to how I'd like it to be. And I have particular tastes. 

> walt disney: we don't make movies to make money. we make money to make movies. 

# walking down an endless hallway
like PT but instead of a traditional horror it's more of a surrealist existential horror. I'm going to do the same everything, everyday for the rest of my life until I die. is this what life is? so I was exploring this idea for my game but fuck it bro. I really deal with this in real life [[seek-work-that-energizes-you]] REMEMBER this lol

# atb battle system
real time action builds up an action bar where you enter their mind and inflict hell upon them. 

# am I too happy?
sometimes I feel like I was a lot more creative as a kid. you could attribute it to a lack of inhibitions but I also think it was just the fact that I didn't have life quite as figured out as I do now. I'm pretty happy. Relaxed. Nothing really gets to me anymore. Nice for maturity but maybe not that good for art lol. 

but I want to be the sun. 
manbuns are in again. I want to grow out my hair. 
I'm just not someone who enjoys speed
