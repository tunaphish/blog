# Planned Spontonaiety
A principle I've seen a lot. This is important for creative work that focuses on... being creative. Following insights and connections as they inspire and lead you somewhere. How do you enforce rigid structure and self discipline on something that is inherently inspiration based. You have a structure that plans for spontonaeity and rewards it. 

- timeblocking: planning for flexibility. things will crop up last minute. 
- vacations: have a framework. some idea of what you want to do. some must hits. but then go with the flow. 
- creative work: sit down and write from your constellation but don't force it?

# biohacking
biohacking in general seems like something I'd be interested in although I haven't given it a lot of research. I'm fairly wary of this kind of stuff though ever since 4 hour body, that book about daily routines that was actually just shilling for supplements. 

there's solid stuff that makes inherent sense. all the [[keystone-habits]] but I don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater. 

## Using drugs to enhance creative endeavors.
1. 5-6-21 I was using edibles quite a bit this weekend and it really felt like it fueled my creative pursuits a lot. I had bursts of inspiration that I haven't had in a while for reaper and I was flying through thoughts that I've had in my mind for a long time and connecting ideas. 
2. some recent research I did into microdosing seems to support what I've been feeling. Maybe I can chat with zach a bit about this. 


# how to read books
> Absorb what is useful, reject what is useless, add what is essentially your own. 
> -- Bruce Lee

I read an anecdote about someone who rereads The Alchemist after life events and how each time they read it they connect with a different character. People tend to only remember the peaks and ending of a film. 

If everything is meaningful then nothing is. This is okay. Not every piece of your wardrobe should be a statement piece. The rest of your outfit is meant to complement that statement piece. Pareto principle. 

# building anticipation
Somethings are meant to build anticipation. And then paying off that antcipation. 

Suspense movies are like this. Jump scares are oftentimes derided but if there's nothing that ever shocks you then the tension building doesn't ever really amount to anything does it? It's made scarier because you are anticipating something. Sometimes the scariest scenes don't come from horror movies. Parasite was so good at this when the poor family was stuck inside the rich family's house. 

People, balk at having a scheduled love making session. However, because it's something that is scheduled, you are looking forward to it. Anticipating it. This is antithetical to spontaneous sex that people generally seem to favor and pervades media because media portrays new love and not old love. Considered unromantic and unsexy. Counterpoint is that with spontaneous sex is similar to my jump scare argument. You still anticipate spontaneous sex with the added benefit that you don't know when it's coming which increases the tension. 

# morning papers - june 9th

so what am I writing about this morning. stream of consciousness. maybe I'm done after all! that was fast. 

last night I stayed up til like 2am. I still have these regressions which suck but I'm not too worried about it like I once was. There's optimizing yourself and your energy levels.
but there's also resilience right? Maybe I should read grit. I kind of want to start a book club or something. I really love these fantasy playlists. The person is posting their universe. The associated drawing. A playlist with it. Everything's just... chill. So yeah I do think there's room for more creative elements in this space. It feels like a tool dominated by academics and programmers. Philosophy. So while those subjects do interest me. I want this to be a place where I make creative connections as well you know. 

I'm quite happy that people are starting to come into the office again.. I really needed these human connections haha. Well... I think that is it. Maybe I'm too tired. There actually isn't too much springing to my mind right now. 

Wonder why it was so hard for me to sleep last night. I did spend a fair amount of time. 

Maybe I'll add a storybook at some point. It'd be cool to have that viewpoint on all the components I've created over the years. 

This is the first personal site where I truly felt connected with it. Every other time I was just doing the usual rote thing. Create a blog. Put your portfolio here. But this style truly resonates with me and is super unique. 


for my daily writing habit chain I think I'll spend maybe 40 minutes on writing whether it's morning habits or it's a topic imposed here. afterwords I'll spend like 20 minutes on revision. 


what messages am I trying to convey to the world? there's a parallel between working hard, doing the same thing over and over again and video games. or something. visual novels. 


I spent a lot of time on tiktok yesterday as well. wasn't particularly inspired by anything I saw. should limit down that time even further. 
I should figure out what's we should do for non high spa nights... haha



# morning papers - jun 10th
## this weekend with lana
hello again me! nice to see you. Today's my last working day and I am not looking forward to this weekend. Lana's going to be staying at my place for the weekend. I kind of just need to force muyself to do things though because I never look forward to anything but when I look back or even when it's happening I always think, I'm glad I did it. We're supposed to be doing ranier saturday. Will have a nice picnic at the bottom or something. Probably run some errands or something. 

## yesterday's suntime funtime.
Yesterday was a blast though. A bunch of people came to the office and had an amazing time. In the morning we played with the dogs, got poke and took a long lunch by the spheres and then just relaxed in the afternoon. Feeling pretty recharged honestly. **I really enjoy eating outside by the spheres.** I think that's one takeaway is that I'm going to consistently head out there for some suntime. Maybe I'll take bear with me as well. Hope Rena can eventually compound her breaks and she can come meet me by the spheres to grab something to eating

jas, krushi and tadeo should be coming around today so that'll be fun.

## constellations
I eventually decided on a theme for my project. Constellations. I love Maggie's garden allegory. However, her focus is on the idea of growing your ideas over time (which is something I still want to implement) but I'm putting a lot more emphasis on the interconnectivity of ideas. In the DAG they straight up look like stars in the sky. There's no way I couldn't call it a constellation. The second runner up was how they kind of looked like neurons firing in a brain. In the end I'm a sucker for the stars though. Somebody should take that idea though because there's a lot more obvious parallels with creating an exocortex. 

### tackiness
there was that tiktok that discussed how you actually brand something. I need to come back to that because I might be slipping too far into tackiness. Like I was thinking about converting my phish logo into a zodiac sign looking thing haha. whereas you should be trying to emphasize

### warmth in space
space has a strong association with cold tones for good reason. deep, nebulous vacuum void of space. However, the way I wanted to trend my life. the colors I've been attaching myself to have been warm. I think there's a real void in my life for that kind of stuff. I'm closer to a Type A person. Fairly logically minded, in a software engineering position surrounded by that type. Just want to be a more well rounded person. anyways this was a long winded way of saying I wanted the theming to convey more warmth and be more inviting. 

# jun 11th

yesterday was tiring but fun. got to spend a fair amount of time socializing at work and hanging out with lana and jason who's visiting. kizuki wasn't as bad (to me) this time around although I definitely won't be going back. 

read a few more passages from staff engineer.
## to lead you have to follow
## stay aligned with authority
you have to be able to execute on your leaders plans. another passage that comes back to alignment. obviously you've arrived here because you are a leader but part of being means aligning worldviews with others. 

the power an individual can achieve pales in comparison to what an organization can achieve. the trade off is aligning those worldviews and sacrificing your unique vision. how does this scale up to a mega conglomerate like Amazon? each individual voice is lost in a sea of others but there's some guiding vision. some shared worldview all pushing us in the same direction? enacting an enormous prescence on the world. 

# jun 12th

yesterday was a fairly exhausting day. we went rock climbing and then to gameworks. my hands are tight attempting to type this lol. 

I thought a lot about whether or not I'd invest time into learning how to rock climb. today we're supposed to ride go karts. That lead me to think about how we've been doing a lot of like (fun but random activities). Fun for fun's sake is fine butit made me think about caleb's chat about exposure and time which is a rehash of the [[favor-depth-of-experience-over-breadth]] argument. he had another take that I hadn't considered but it was just opportunity cost. I guess this only applies to certain things but at any point you can drop something and get more exposure somewhere else. but that means you have to invest that time again if you want to acquire a similar level of depth there. 

knowledge workers generally don't train their fundamentals. 


abundance mentality
growth mentality
truly believing in yourself 
building tension and anticipation 
audience only remembers peaks and valleys

To provide sponsorship you have to be in the room. Need mentorship to understand sponsorship. 

Leaders have a clear idea of how things ought to be. And care enough to make it so. 

Misunderstood. Is usually right. Eventually right. Not every meeting they came into with right answer. Arrive at the right answer. Some ways are by Meeting everyone’s needs. Making Little bets. Keeping doors open.

I'm just not someone who enjoys speed



I can finally read from my kindle again now that I've resolved not to take notes at night

[[pareto-principle]] for clothing would just be fit 
base layers should convey atheltic and masculine frame. 

food with friends -> [[focus-on-one-thing-at-a-time]]
two hat theory (in dev workflow),  you are developing features. or you are refactoring. rule of thumb is one doesn't break or add tests. the other does. -> [[focus-on-one-thing-at-a-time]]

# clear your mind
In the morning I strive to get working on my knowledge work as fast as possible so the actual routine is fairly minimal. Some hygiene for myself and the dogs and coffee then it's a short walk to the office. Then it's a few exercises to clear my mind like [[inbox-zero]] and morning papers. After that I eat the frog and focus on design work if possible. I try to figure out what decisions I need to make throughout the day and make those decisions, this generally  means that design work (the hardest work) is done in the morning. these tasks are generally punctuated using pomodoro's. the break time should be used to address whatever was my biggest distraction from getting into [[flow-state]]. sometimes this is my lower back pain so I'll do a few stretches. other times it's my need to socialize so I'll play with the dog or chat with my coworkers. . sometimes it's just a general lack of focus. of which can usually be cleared with some meditation. 

# training inputs
[[do-not-touch-your-mouse]] ... another idea for some dexterity work but just a good way of increasing your flow state. a good idea for a video! there's even a website for it. video starts off with me standing up and throwing my mouse straight in the trash. I'll even have an after credits scene where I dig my mouse out of the trash because you need your mouse at least some of the time. one of the biggest ones would probably be how to navigate safari with just my keyboard. another fun experiment would be doing my morning papers through dictation instead of physically typing it myself. I think the biggest issue would be creating links though actually. I never noticed but this intellij isn't just for spelling. It is actually suggesting markdown shortcuts which is pretty cool. 

I have lots of stray thoughts throughout the day that I'd like to record. wonder what would be the mechanism for that. Generally I want to use these morning sessions to do so but lightning strikes at odd times. 

# knowledge training fundamentals
what would be considered fundamentals for knowledge work. when can I do this too. might be a good way of kicking off my mechanical work session. these are the kinds of skills I want to keep fresh in my mind. another video idea. training fundamentals for knowledge work and developing an SRS system from my exocortex (constellations). 
1. recall
2. problem decomposition (leetcode? are they fundamentals) TDD : )


another reason why reddit sucks. second hand opinions. try to focus on primary sources. not secondary sources. aka take the facts and come to your own observations. stop basing your opinions on other people's opinions. don't let other people tell you how to feel. (for research... not when chatting or things of that nature)

these notes rarely reflect my final or even my actual thoughts. some may be contradictory to what I think. however, to fully empower this method of notetaking I need to be able to link ideas, reconcile conflicting ideas or even discredit some of them. 

videos are good because they emphasize other skills that I lack. like speaking or conveying espression. things of that nature.

Meds over events over project work

Connecting ideas to make concentrations.  Like Korean fashion reapers... connecting concentrations to other concentrations. Concepts to other concepts. Stories to other stories. Mechanics to other mechanics.  Coffee shop. New wave coffee vs old wave coffee. Conversations in there.  Nihilism vs... not nihilism. Sei breaks their spirit. Eli encourages them to move on. Live a life with no regrets. In comparison the work I’m doing right now feels really dry. How do you exhibit this kind of enthusiasm for bullshit...  I kind of want to cruise right now. 

applying smart note taking to creative work. There’s two parts. Generating ideas. Mechanical work. The mechanics follow from the idea. The message. Kind of like baushaus. Form follows function. In this case the form is the concentration. Aka reaper daddies. 

System for managing resources. Ingredients get delivered. Fresh ones go bad. You have to preserve which lowers their usefulness or changes it.  Some rare ingredients to bad after a day. You concoct potions from them. Rarer potions require a bunch of rare items delivered at once. You can supplement buy buying specialty ingredients but it’s expensive. 

Gather ideas in one place. Connecting them in novel ways. Let them produce ideas for you. Gather the best ideas from games you played. Stories you read visuals from movies. The coolest scene from moody was stabbing in the background. but it also allows you to develop ideas in parallel. This means you have multiple projects cooking. But like academic work there’s mechanical steps that need to be done. Instead of rearranging ideas and deleting redundant sentences. You are filming shots. Or you are drawing some lines.  Remember the Pareto principal for short films is the strength of the script. It can apply again to mechanical work but it’s like 80 percent of the 20 percent. Numbers may be off but the point is some things are higher Impact. 

Morning papers should last until the stream ends. Then focus on editing your thoughts. This also means your sprint system might go out of date? Then what do you do films on... well it comes as a result of exocortex right? There needs to be something external to the exocortex guiding practical work. He probably talks about this later on actually. 

Line thickness is a practical specific thing. Your exocortex needs to be conceptual and general.

gacha system <-> runescape clone

well this is fun. Wanted to shoot out my website and finally move onto other stuff. super frustrating. I guess one lesson learned is to avoid 3rd party libraries or at the very least test things as you go. just because something is working in development mode doesn't mean it will work in the production build mode. 


I wonder if it's a folly to try and break my life into sprints and instead put my focus onto things where my focus lies. I should probably read the rest of the book though. reading the book has been really inspiring. having this "slip box" of ideas to dump into. connecting them. letting throw grow and come together gels exactly with how I work. the challenge comes from converting this for creative pursuits. 

my take with how this progresses for practical project is there's an external system. but it sounds like you need to be comfortable picking up and dropping things. which makes it a bit difficult as I want to start pumping out projects. maybe projects should be smaller in scope? especially video games? sprints could probably be consolidated down to one week even. let's see what the rest of the book has to say. 

as I read about more and more productivity systems it, I start agreeing with bruce lee's take more. things will naturally jump out at you based on where you are on life and that's okay. 


I had all these game ideas over the years that I sort of just forgot about. I attached gameplay and styles together. but what if that isn't necessarily what I wanted to do. what if I just had the random stylistic ideas. then random game ideas. scene ideas. and then craft a game out of all those things later... I'm getting really ambitious again when I don't even draw currently so maybe let's focus on this ideating phase right now. 


creating a space for your endeavors is so important... 

recognizing those spaces is important too
