# books are ineffective mediums for transferring knowledge
this is because they rely on "transmissionism" to convey information. author has knowledge. author writes that knowledge in a book. audience reads the book. audience gains the author's knowledge. this is obviously not how knowledge transfer works. 

> you have to actively engage in material to understand it. 
it ignores the way people understand and learn. 
1. emotions (the enthusiasm from a good professor, a fiction book conveying philosophy through tragic prose about human stories)
2. creative projects
3. active engagement
4. visuals
5. exploration (testing boundaries of ideas, disagreeing with it, synthesizing it, relating to other material, derive new ideas)
6. recall and spacing

exocortex has a somewhat organic way of training spacing and recall outside of SRS. if you are able to make a connection back to a topic that you haven't thought about in a while that's a form of recall and strengthing the connection. 


this means two things
1. having a better understanding of how you learn [[metacognition]]
2. there is room for exploring mediums that align with how humans understand 
   1. [[the-advantages-of-videogames-as-a-medium]] align with some of these learning models although videogames rarely convey information in this way because for the most part they are designed for entertainment first. 

# Using drugs to enhance creative endeavors.
1. 5-6-21 I was using edibles quite a bit this weekend and it really felt like it fueled my creative pursuits a lot. I had bursts of inspiration that I haven't had in a while for reaper and I was flying through thoughts that I've had in my mind for a long time and connecting ideas. 
2. some recent research I did into microdosing seems to support what I've been feeling. Maybe I can chat with zach a bit about this. 


# staff engineer notes
## expectations
I want to get a grasp on what my career tract is likely to look like and the role I am going to play and the skills I need to develop

## types
1. tech lead
2. architect
3. problem solver
4. the right hand

## benefits
1. credentials
2. pay
3. being in the room aka influence

## responsibilities

## work on what matters
no ghosts, playing the game too much or snacking
1. exisistential threads
2. things lacking attention
3. editing and finishing things
4. growth
5. doing only what you can

## writing engineering strategy
> people often conflate strategy with innovation. good strategy is boring though.
strategies and visions are concise documents that guide decision making (tenets) for teams, align priority. necessary when the same conversations keep getting rehashed or it is unclear what tech investments should be made. basically when future ambiguity gets in the way of execution for teams today
## the process
1. take five designs
2. consolidate similarities into a strategies
3. take five strategies
4. consolidate strategies into a vision

tip for design is to keep crafting your problem statement until your solution is clear
## current summary
defines what a staff engineer is, their responsibilities, the archetypes and why you want to be one and the ways to get into that tract

Cologne everyday
Less shampoo
Colder shorter showers
Scentless
Shave every other day 

Maybe I’ll take a strength training class. I want to formalize my workout more.  How does this work with Rena. Her daily walks to and from work are good. Maybe when we move and workout in the same gym it’ll be better. Puts another point in the Hyde square bucket. 
Tucker says you should put your beliefs out there to be challeneved 
I should figure out what's we should do for non high spa nights... haha
quite upsetting that the spheres aren't open right now...


# benefits of blogs as a media
1. can link to web
2. contextualized with a date
3. possibility for interactivity... 

has interactivity really been something that I care about? well I do consider it a major benefit for video games. the issue with a blog though is does it break focus? maybe not... you have to interact with something in order to understand that. I know that to be true. so the breaks in your reading aren't necessarily bad. but you do risk losing the built up mental model within your mind. from there I think that means Ideas should only be nested one. maybe two times. otherwise you risk having the context be too large. this is another thing that supports atomicity of notes. that you can't carry too much contextual information at once. 
to go back onto the topic of if I care about interactivity in blogs. I'm not sure. it's certainly cool... I want to do it. but why. what am I trying to do with it. how does it help what I am trying to do. what am I trying to do with a blog in the first place?
first off I think I can nix the blog again. I can apply these same benefits to my garden.
So what's the purpose? To aid in understanding.. but also to inspire and this one is big for me. Digital gardens often trend towards written note taking and want to shift my focus onto videogames at some point (which are also interactive) but a fairly visual medium... even though I want to explore visual novels lol. anyways because they are visual I want to be not only be inspired visually but to flex my creative visual muscles. I'm also publishing this online. This is somewhat of a vain attempt to get people to think it's cool as well but also inspire other people as well. 

I'm not doing morning papers as they were intended. I want to go over these notes eventually and refine them whereas I think the original point was to just dump anything on your mind and just get a fresh start on the day. Empty your mind. There's that bruce lee idea. I should look it up. 
about taking what is useful. discarding what's not. and then adding those ideas to your repetoire. 

please put on your mask before attempting to help others (in relation to finding work that energizes you instead of focusing on impact. metaphors!)
show up the same place everyday.
the issue with the team room is it's isolating... where can I go to work that's more public and I can intermingle with other people? at the same time I am doing focus work where I kind of need to be in the mothafucking zone chief. so how can I work this in with deep work. there are the dedicated break times for pomodoros. 

how long are morning papers supposed to last anyways? I genuinely thought I'd have enough time to just kind of hash everything out. like I'd be done within 15 minutes.
instead I'm 35 minutes in and I'm still going. I am at a starting junction point with this... also I keep jumping around to preorganize my thoughts but maybe that's left for later. I am not going to enjoy tending to this during my afternoon cleanup session


 I am deeply inspired by andy (cant pronounce his last name)'s garden. his thoughts are so matured. his writing has a rich vocabulary. mine is fairly juvenile in comparison haha. 


[[keystone-habits]]  are so much more important then anything else. if you aren't healthy then everything else suffers. yet this isn't entirely true. this isn't what energizes me. doing this work right here. these morning papers. these mixing of ideas. this is what energizes me. not only that but I see people with the absolute WORST health habits. eating terribly. so how are these people able to operate? people are different I guess. I defintely need to be in tune with all my habits in order to operate effectively. 


do I really care about cursing?
cursing inherently doesn't really mean anything. it's just historical context. 
so cursing is really about who you are communicating to then like I wouldn't curse to my mom but I curse to my homies. this is a place for myself and any strangers that are perusing these I guess. So while I don't mind cursing I read (somewhere) that you generally want to go down to the level that most people are comfortable with. which would be no cursing as people who curse generally wouldn't mind that I did.

but then again.. I'm operating in a niche here right. Who's really going to read this. practically nobody. digital gardens are a fairly niche subject at the moment. that means there's a space to shine? to inspire. to truly connect and be who I am? probably thinking about this for too long. [[decision-making-length-should-be-proportional-to-importance]] and this doesn't really matter too much

back to focus work


# work and personal digital garden...


# digital gardens
Hi, I'm Tuan, a software engineer at Amazon Music. 
Welcome to my Garden!

This is my place to tend to and nurture ideas. They often start out as sprouts from other gardens and they benefit from connecting with eachother in unexpected ways and become wholly new ideas. Hopefully, then I can mature it until they become evergreen. 

If you don't know where to start why not go to my [[inbox]]. It's where I jot down anything currently on my mind until it finds a home. 
Alternatively, the graph you see behind the text is actually a web of how my notes are interconnected and clicking on any node will take you to that note with the graph being a subset of the ideas that are connected to it. 

If you see anything that provokes you feel free to chat with me about it! Right now I am trying to [[participate-in-online-communities]] more often. 

let's just edit this during the sprint planning session because I have A LOT of thoughts here but also practical things I want to get done and I don't want to forget about it. 

# current aesthetic - asian baby girl (but make it boy?)
I've been seeing this visual trend a lot and I kind of want to emulate a guy version of it. A lot of the aesthetics are really cool. I am also probably misattributing characteristics that don't define an ABG but it's just a general inspiration for me and not necessarilly a 1:1 of what I want to achieve. Writing this out made me realize what aesthetic I want to strive for whereas it was lost on me for a while. Can't wait!
1. delicate floral tattoos
2. bleach blond hair
3. colored contacts
4. earthy toned clothing
5. aesthetic fitness 
6. DANGLY MF EARRINGS 
7. They tend to dress less conservatively but not sure how to emulate that as a male!
8. I also really love long flowing cardigans and jackets. I already have a few of them. 

one big reason I am drawn so much to this aesthetic is because a lot of it runs counter to normal aesthetics that developers tend to prefer. 
1. minimalism
2. black, white neutral tones
3. RBG (saturated colors and lights)

there's [[inherent-value-in-diversity]] and introducing other aesthetics to the scene creates diversity for others but also makes you stand out.
