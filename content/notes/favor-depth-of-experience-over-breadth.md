# Favor Depth of Experience of Breadth
TODO

There's a common line of thought that you should favor experiences over material possessions. This comes from a rejection of consumerism and the belief that a life rich in experiences is one way to [[minimize-regret]]. However, there are several flaws with this line of thinking. 

You can acquire a deep appreciation for material possessions. This is a philosophy touted by Marie Kondo often. Mindlessly consuming material posessions is bad. People focus on the consuming material posessions part. The true evil is the mindlessly part. Acquiring material posessions with intent, appreciating them, taking proper care of them all lead to a healthier relationship with material goods. Minimalism often flies too far in the opposite direction where you pare down as many items as you possibly can. However this oftentimes lead to outsourcing different parts of your life. For example if you pared down your toolkit and now you needed to borrow a hammer from a neighbhor. Although the idea of community items to reduce overall in the consumption in the world is admirable t at oftentimes isn't really the goal or intent of reducing how much stuff you have. 

Oftentimes there's a collector's fallacy with experiences as well. Acquiring a list of experiences, things you've done just to say you've done them. Showing off pictures on social media. *expound on this more*

There's a different kind of a joy, and an experience onto itself by focusing on depth over breadth. Like your monogamous relationship and savoring the growth of one individual overtime instead transient superficial idiosyncrasies of a group of people. Deeply exploring an individual dishs and discovering its depth and appreciating the nuance. 

Another reason why I dislike productivity as an industry. productivity gurus oftentimes are only good at pumping out producvitiy material but don't actually do anything...
