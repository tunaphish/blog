title: Favor Depth of Experience over Breadth
---
There's a different kind of a joy, and an experience onto itself by focusing on depth over breadth. Like your monogamous relationship and savoring the growth of one individual overtime instead transient superficial idiosyncrasies of a group of people. Deeply exploring an individual dishs and discovering its depth and appreciating the nuance. 

you always have the opportunity to gather more exposure. find another job. get another girlfriend. but once you sacrifice your chance at depth (for certain things) it's gone. leave a team and your job's on the market. leave your girlfriend and you aren't getting her back. 

# appreciating a material life
There's a common line of thought that you should favor experiences over material possessions. This comes from a rejection of consumerism and the belief that a life rich in experiences is one way to [[minimize-regret]]. However, there are several flaws with this line of thinking. 

You can acquire a deep appreciation for material possessions. This is a philosophy touted by Marie Kondo often. Mindlessly consuming material posessions is bad. People focus on the consuming material posessions part. The true evil is the mindlessly part. Acquiring material posessions with intent, appreciating them, taking proper care of them all lead to a healthier relationship with material goods. Minimalism often flies too far in the opposite direction where you pare down as many items as you possibly can. However this oftentimes lead to outsourcing different parts of your life. For example if you pared down your toolkit and now you needed to borrow a hammer from a neighbhor. Although the idea of community items to reduce overall in the consumption in the world is admirable t at oftentimes isn't really the goal or intent of reducing how much stuff you have. 

# collector's fallacy but make it for experiences
Oftentimes there's a collector's fallacy with experiences as well. Acquiring a list of experiences, things you've done just to say you've done them. Showing off pictures on social media. *expound on this more*


# random bullshit
I thought a lot about whether or not I'd invest time into learning how to rock climb. today we're supposed to ride go karts. That lead me to think about how we've been doing a lot of fun but random activities. I wonder if this is how people generally live their lives. Going from one fun activitiy to the next. Random things that hold your interest until you die. It's fine. This passage reads like it's mocking that line of thought but it's not. 

But I can't help but think that people would be happier if they found more depth in their lives. This is antithetical to finding your passion being a poor way to live though.
