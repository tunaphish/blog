# life tenets

## "you have to start romanticizing your life"
There's this idea that social media is bad because it exaggerates the life of those around you. People post their highlight reals having you think it's the real thing. Romanticising your life.. Means that you do it too. You feed into that cycle.

I think there is room for both? Avoiding the highlight real but accepting the boringness of life. Romanticize your boring life. Because those are the things that matter. Being in the moment and appreciating each day by day. Each breath. Each moment. I think that's the way to go. 

Another reason for this is helping others. Mainly Rena live her life as well. She is a natural homebody as well and although I depend on her to force us out of the house I need to emphasize that as well. 

## [[keystone-habits]] > Events > Project Work > Actual Work
> But the 8-hour workday is too profitable for big business, not because of the amount of work people get done in eight hours (the average office worker gets less than three hours of actual work done in 8 hours) but because it makes for such a purchase-happy public. Keeping free time scarce means people pay a lot more for convenience, gratification, and any other relief they can buy. It keeps them watching television, and its commercials. It keeps them unambitious outside of work. - **your lifestyle has already been designed**

### work effort theory in corporations
This theory applies to office workers where they do not have equity in the company. 
Why invest yourself so much where you wonâ€™t benefit. The idea is work hard get promoted and that is where you see benefit. Is this the way it plays out though? Is it really worth it?
It is inherently disproportionate the value you generate for a company vs your compensation. Why tip the scales even further but giving more of your time to a company?

The argument for why it's acceptable for a company to take more money is because they take on the risk. But that becomes unacceptable after a certain point. It's not a blank check. It's a sliding scale for more risk that you take on, the more cash you are entitled to. It is also not zero risk. You can lose your job at the whim of your employer.

The argument for software developers a lot of the time is just leave a company after a couple years and use lateral movement to move up. companies seem to reward this behavior as well with expiring bonuses. 

#### My job finances everything else in my life 
The counterpoint is that your actual work will have the most outsized impact on your life. The effort I gave into leetcoding and succeeding in my job gave me the literal capitol I required in order to get my other affairs in order and help Rena live a better life. I use very premium skincare now which is something I care about. I don't have crazy expensive hobbies but I can go to the hospital whenever I need to for my health. I pay for an expensive ass gym but that's also because I live downtown for my job. I want a personal gym but I can't really do something like that here. 

## be present in the moment
- have long term goals
- be agile
  
I keep going between mapping a year to see where you could place yourself. And then just focusing on what you are going to do this week. 
The farther out you plan the more ambiguity there is. with literally everything. The things I wanted a year ago aren't the things I want now. 

I think the key here is that the further out things are the less definition and structure I should have. Be in the moment and focus on what you have to do today. On what you have to do right now. 

## focus on "real life" not just digital life
### real art vs digital art
Before I conclusively said digital art was the way I wanted to go because the hobbies I decided for myself at the time. Game development. Making stickers and shit. 

Recently though I've discovered a tenet for myself regarding balance. Most of my inclinations push me towards online life. My job, video games, gathering information. 

My other hobbies should trend the other direction if possible. Plus I am discovering a lust (weird word choice) for real life. In that other things are taking precedent. Taste, textures, smells. All food related... But basically living life in my flesh instead of my just my mind which online life exacerbates. 

Eh fuck it I can do both.

### cons of the internet
It encourages passivity. It gives an outlet to so many things without actually meaningfully changing anything. In the world. In yourself. This can be countered when you [[participate-in-communities]] but it's not the natural fold of things. 

## project timelines and goals as of july 2021
- focus on personal habits right now (creative works and projects since that's the side of myself I want to develop right now ASSTHETICS)
    - bring art into the real world somehow
- after I move focus on environmental design starting with kitchen, workspace and bedroom?
- finally focus on others, hosting events, hanging with people socially, friends, dogs, rena, family

# minimalism tenets
1. you should never be able to say "I forgot I had this". What's the point of having it then. Either discard it or place it somewhere where you will be able to get it when you need it. 
2. your posessions should 'spark joy'
3. focus on what matters (essentialism), not having less
