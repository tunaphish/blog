title: Tenets

tenets need to guide [[decision-making]]. when there's a tradeoff between two competing goals then a tenet is required 

# life tenets
1. "you have to start romanticizing your life"
## [[keystone-habits]] > Events > Project Work > Actual Work
The counterpoint is that your actual work will have the most outsized impact on your life. The effort I gave into leetcoding and succeeding in my job gave me the literal capitol I required in order to get my other affairs in order and help Rena live a better life. 

## focus on "real life" not just digital life
### real art vs digital art
Before I conclusively said digital art was the way I wanted to go because the hobbies I decided for myself at the time. Game development. Making stickers and shit. 

Recently though I've discovered a tenet for myself regarding balance. Most of my inclinations push me towards online life. My job, video games, gathering information. 

My other hobbies should trend the other direction if possible. Plus I am discovering a lust (weird word choice) for real life. In that other things are taking precedent. Taste, textures, smells. All food related... But basically living life in my flesh instead of my just my mind which online life exacerbates. 

Eh fuck it I can do both. I did need to write this down though. 

### cons of the internet
It encourages passivity. It gives an outlet to so many things without actually meaningfully changing anything. In the world. In yourself. This can be countered when you [[participate-in-communities]] but it's not the natural fold of things. 

# minimalism tenets
1. you should never be able to say "I forgot I had this". What's the point of having it then. Either discard it or place it somewhere where you will be able to get it when you need it. 
2. your posessions should 'spark joy'
3. focus on what matters (essentialism), not having less
