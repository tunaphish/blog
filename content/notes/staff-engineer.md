title: Staff Engineer
---
Encompasses the highest levels of the individual contributor track for an engineer's career. Has a noticeable jump in ambiguity between staff and senior. Not in the level of ambiguity in the problems you face, although it does increase but the level of ambiguity in job responsibilities as well. The breadth of responsibilities is wide enough that individuals tend to find themselves falling into pretty common archetypes of staff engineer. 
1. tech lead
2. architect
3. right hand
4. problem solver

# Responsibilities
## sponsorship vs mentorship
mentorship is giving advice, sponsorship is giving opportunities.
oftentimes opportunies are what is needed not advice. your mentorship time can be used to explore your mentee's interests, talents, to help inform your sponsorship.

## being glue
'glue work' is work required to make the project succeed but falls outside the realm of 'promotable' work. it's expected when you are a staff engineer but detrimental when you aren't. be conscious of how much voluntary, non-promotable work you are doing and focus on the core skills you want to be developing.
