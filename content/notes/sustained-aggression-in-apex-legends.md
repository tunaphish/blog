title: sustained aggression in apex legends
---
common advice in battle royales is defensive play is the way to get more wins. the reason for this is the goal is to win, not get kills. however, there's some nuance to apex legends that makes this a little different. 

## lack of loot
loot disparity isn't so big a factor in apex that you'll live or die but your drops (except for your guns). however, over time though this will trend your wins in a certain direction. my rule of thumb currently is that if you don't have a red shield by end game then you were not aggressive enough. 

## third parties
a common rule of thumb for apex is that a fight is lasting more then half to a full minute then you need to leave. the reason for this is third parties. the takeaway for most people is that you should be disengaging from a lot of fights. but what I've noticed from many pro players, is that fights will finish relatively quickly because they push hard even on what seems like minor advantages. the counterpoint is that they can push on minor advantages because their aim will save them though. 

## pushing on advantage
This doesn't just mean health advantage. It also means ammo and position. this is something I struggle with a lot. but if I have less health my inclination is always to reset. however, this isn't the beat that I always need to follow. reloads are huge in apex and if you can push during an enemy reload then you can almost always secure a down.
