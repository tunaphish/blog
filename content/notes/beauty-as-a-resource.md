title: Beauty as a Resource
---

Being beautiful has literal worth in this world. And investing in it will have high returns in life. Whether it is fair to behave this way in a knowledge based society is irrelevant as you should [[strive-for-ideals-operate-practically]]. 

# myself and my relationship
Attraction is not a choice. I fully believe in this. And just because you aren't dating doesn't mean that this doesn't continue to be true or even become less important. You should strive to become an attractive partner for the person that you love. 

# how men treat beauty 
encourages dispassionate feeling. logic. that's not what I want to be all the time even though that's my modus operandi. 
there's a sense of superiority in male dominated spaces (reddit, development) about transcending popular culture. things like not giving a shit about your appearance. how you come across to other people. ignoring feelings. 

# halo effect
There's actual observed scientific evidence that more attractive people are also perceived to have better personalities. 

# only fans, insta models
for a lot of women (and men) beauty is literally their core competency. They model, they sell their body and they advertise products that people will buy because they are beautiful

# fairy tales
It is similar messaging we give children. The princess and the hero are beautiful and pure. The villains are ugly and evil. 

# Athleisure
Communicates beauty within and without. I care about my body and I wear beautiful clothes.
