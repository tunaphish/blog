title: Making Friends Post College
---
a lot of people find it difficult to make friends after college. the need for human connection doesn't go away but the easy environment where you see the same people day after day with the same shared experiences does. For me I always wanted that core group of friends that you hang out with day after day. The kind you see in sitcoms like How I Met your Mother. I actually did have that for a bit with the boys back in Florida but life doesn't always work out in that way. So yeah I really just want to make some cool friends out here in Seattle. I am afraid of rejection. Afraid to [[allow-yourself-to-be-vulnerable]]. Really keeps coming back to that doesn't it.

# shared experiences 
I guess a lot of it involves going to the same places a lot similar to why you should [[participate-in-communities]]. finding a community for the things I want to share in like art. I keep saying I need to actually have some base level competency to put myself out there in those spaces. But I guess that's what austin was talking about when he said [[be-an-amateur]]

# lead an interesting life, and invite people to it 
let things happen organically. life doesn't really work like that does it. live a life where you do cool stuff. invite people to do cool stuff. Again I never want to invite people to do things. Like why would this person want to hang out with me lol. Ah well. 

cool stuff I want to try around here
