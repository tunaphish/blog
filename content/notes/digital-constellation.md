# why write notes in this style 
1. tailored: to your learning style, interests, thought processes
2. curated: how many times did you look up a recipe... only to have to filter through all the shit recipes people post online. 
3. distilled
4. [[writing-is-the-only-thing-that-matters]]
5. it is beautiful... I love just looking at these graphs 
   
## interconnected information 
1. unique ideas and insights. ideas in isolation aren't that interesting. in fact they are more then likely derivative and already thought of. the way ideas link, contrast and intertwine is what makes them interesting. 
2. organic spaced repetition. you naturally stumble back onto ideas you've had before via this style of notetaking thus keeping those mental models fresh in your mind

## tool for thinking 
Honestly just writing out my thoughts have done wonders in order to reconcile what I am thinking. To think of an argument and to inspect it at the same time is just too much. Just having it written out and reducing how much working memory you have to consume helps streamline my thinking process. I also have multiple conflicting ideologies and tenets for life that this helps to reconcile and prioritize. 

# difference with traditional note taking
Traditional notetaking has two general disadvantages. It starts with hypothesis first. You research to support this hypothesis instead of letting inspiration, insights guide your theories backed by your already existing body of information. 

the second disadvantage is that having notes be easily accessible necessitates an organization system which is generally a hierarchy system with a taxonomy of folders and classifications. this isolates ideas from each other and prevents one from being able to create unique or novel connections instead forced into already existing classifications of knowledge. 

# tenets for tending to your digital constellation 
1. notes should be fairly conceptual and general in nature. this helps relate ideas together irrespective of context
2. notes should be declarative. they should assert an opinion. 
3. notes should be atomic. use a wet and dry method. if you find yourself writing about a concept twice then extract into a common note. 
4. notes should be accompanied with a visual. aids in synthesis of ideas and leverages other cognitive models for learning
5. notes should be associated with tags
6. notes should attempt to connect ideas together
7. these notes rarely reflect my final or even my actual thoughts. some may be contradictory to what I think. however, to fully empower this method of notetaking I need to be able to link ideas, reconcile conflicting ideas or even discredit some of them. 

# [[baushaus]] for my digital constellation
the graphs and interconnected ideas are what draw me to this style of notetaking moreso then learning in public and tending to ideas over time 
the graph looks like stars in the sky and the way the interconnect look like constellations. 
this informed the design process to give things a sort of space theme. 

# integrating (private) work topics into 
Constellation exists to link together conceptual ideas to birth unique ideas and insights. the nature of the input and output means that I am only putting in general, conceptual notes in here. Nothing inherent to a project itself. 

# natural clusters in constellations 
Because your mind tends to always come back to the same subject by following your interest it’s a lot easier to keep up with motivation(something I struggle with). Notes naturally tend to cluster around those interests and because your zettlekesten is permanent you are always contributing and furthering something. 

By forming these clusters you organically [[seek-work-that-energizes-you]]

# art in the constellations
Gather ideas in one place. Connecting them in novel ways. Let them produce ideas for you. Gather the best ideas from games you played. Stories you read visuals from movies. The coolest scene from moody was stabbing in the background. but it also allows you to develop ideas in parallel. This means you have multiple projects cooking. But like academic work there’s mechanical steps that need to be done. Instead of rearranging ideas and deleting redundant sentences. You are filming shots. Or you are drawing some lines.  Remember the Pareto principal for short films is the strength of the script. It can apply again to mechanical work but it’s like 80 percent of the 20 percent. Numbers may be off but the point is some things are higher Impact. 

# reconciling following your interests vs discipline
tl;dr follow your interests while ideating. discipline when executing. 

Idea proposed by smart notes that discusses organically following your interests and allowing them to build up and dictate your project plan instead of following a rigid plan from the get. 

Similar to how agile works I think? The idea being that you don't know what customers want so you develop the most important thing now, gather feedback and then move onto the next important thing that was dictated by that feedback and the cycle begins anew. 

However, does this contrast with the idea of [[deep-work-habit-chain]] that proposes you spend a long time focusing on one thing at a time? Maybe not. You are performing work deeply. Just over long time periods. You'll drop it and come back to it again. Smart notes proposes that good ideas take time to build up over the course of months or years. And that by steadily growing ideas and coming back to them organically through connections you are able to actually bring them to a satisfying conclusion. Aligns with [[habit-chain]]s as well. 

It goes against my gut instinct though to dial down things. The hardest part of your project is the last part. Just finishing it. I think the difference is the ideation stage vs the implementation phase. The mechanical phase. People's ideas exist in a nebulous state more often then not. Because [[writing-is-the-only-thing-that-matters]] it's not until you put pen to paper that you realize that your idea wasn't fully thought out. 

# applying smart notes theories for work onto other kinds of work
luhhman has a lot of theories on how to work that fed into his insane productivity. how can I apply it to non writing pursuits. 

## inspiration driven work for drawing 
only work on what inspires you. generally I pick a project. draw some roughs. and then force myself to take a rough and bring it through the rest of the stages. maybe that shouldn't be how it is. I can do something similar to my writing. I can spend the morning ideating. just drawing sketches. and then only from my sketches will I actually generate useful ideas and projects. I'm starting from the end and working backwards when I should be ideating and nurturing ideas over time. remember [[writing-is-the-only-thing-that-matters]] and unless that pen hits the paper then nothing you think in your mind matters. 

## evaluating input streams 
If I'm not inspired to sketch or create that means my input streams aren't good enough. 
Reevaluate what I am consuming. That isn't just limited to what I'm drawing. You can get stuck in ruts consuming the same thing over and over. Shake things up and see what other worlds have yet to be discovered. (this isn't actually luhhman but another digital garden idea I read but don't remember who's it was)
