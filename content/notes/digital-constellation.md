# why write notes in this style 
1. tailored: to your learning style, interests, thought processes
2. curated: how many times did you look up a recipe... only to have to filter through all the shit recipes people post online. 
3. distilled
4. [[writing-is-the-only-thing-that-matters]]
5. it is beautiful... I love just looking at these graphs 
6. interconnected information 
   1. unique ideas and insights
   2. organic spaced repetition. you naturally stumble back onto ideas you've had before via this style of notetaking thus keeping those mental models fresh in your mind

## difference with traditional note taking
Traditional notetaking has two general disadvantages. It starts with hypothesis first. You research to support this hypothesis instead of letting inspiration, insights guide your theories backed by your already existing body of information. 

the second disadvantage is that having notes be easily accessible necessitates an organization system which is generally a hierarchy system with a taxonomy of folders and classifications. this isolates ideas from each other and prevents one from being able to create unique or novel connections instead forced into already existing classifications of knowledge. 

# tenets for tending to your digital constellation 
1. notes should be fairly conceptual and general in nature. this helps relate ideas together irrespective of context
2. notes should be declarative. they should assert an opinion. 
3. notes should be atomic. use a wet and dry method. if you find yourself writing about a concept twice then extract into a common note. 
4. notes should be accompanied with a visual. aids in synthesis of ideas and leverages other cognitive models for learning
5. notes should be associated with tags
6. notes should attempt to connect ideas together
7. these notes rarely reflect my final or even my actual thoughts. some may be contradictory to what I think. however, to fully empower this method of notetaking I need to be able to link ideas, reconcile conflicting ideas or even discredit some of them. 

# [[baushaus]] for my digital constellation
the graphs and interconnected ideas are what draw me to this style of notetaking moreso then learning in public and tending to ideas over time 
the graph looks like stars in the sky and the way the interconnect look like constellations. 
this informed the design process to give things a sort of space theme. 

# integrating (private) work topics into 
Constellation exists to link together conceptual ideas to birth unique ideas and insights. the nature of the input and output means that I am only putting in general, conceptual notes in here. Nothing inherent to a project itself. 

# natural clusters in constellations 
Because your mind tends to always come back to the same subject by following your interest it’s a lot easier to keep up with motivation(something I struggle with). Notes naturally tend to cluster around those interests and because your zettlekesten is permanent you are always contributing and furthering something. 

By forming these clusters you organically [[seek-work-that-energizes-you]]

# art in the constellations
Gather ideas in one place. Connecting them in novel ways. Let them produce ideas for you. Gather the best ideas from games you played. Stories you read visuals from movies. The coolest scene from moody was stabbing in the background. but it also allows you to develop ideas in parallel. This means you have multiple projects cooking. But like academic work there’s mechanical steps that need to be done. Instead of rearranging ideas and deleting redundant sentences. You are filming shots. Or you are drawing some lines.  Remember the Pareto principal for short films is the strength of the script. It can apply again to mechanical work but it’s like 80 percent of the 20 percent. Numbers may be off but the point is some things are higher Impact.
