An engineering principal meant to prevent overengineering a code base. The idea that you don't need to write code anticipating future use cases. Sometimes you don't need a strategy pattern. Sometimes you just need an if statement. Could be a good life philosophy as well lol.  

counterpoint is a good software architect should be able to identify volatility aka the times you are in fact going to need it.
