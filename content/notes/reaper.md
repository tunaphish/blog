# battle system

## mental battles
I really liked the idea of multiple viewpoints existing in your head with Disco Elysium. One way I see this playing out in Reaper is letting emotions build up and unleashing them in attacks. This is where the visuals come into play. The allegory is letting your emotions out vs bottling them up. Expressing yourself. 

attacks are different ways of manipulating emotions. making them pissed off. calming yourself down. then you can attack out of anger, alleviating yourself of that emotion. 

in traditional fights you will invade their mind directly and do a few things. 
- assess how they're feeling
- search for weak points 
- manipulate their emotions (make them angry, hit harder but less accurately)

good jrpg battles force you to make hard decisions. 

## physical battles 
then in real life you fight normally using an ATB system. real time action builds up an action bar where you enter their mind and inflict hell upon them. 

finally to execute them you have to swipe across their neck. 

## your first reaper battles 
one day your target doesn't have too many descriptors. but one noticeable one is they have a lengthy coat which sei notices. 

during the battle he will invade both your minds. sei will have depressing thoughts. it doesn't matter. if we die we die. eji will attempt to rouse himself out more positively. I can do this. don't let her get to you. 

this reaper, keshi, is someone you'll commonly have interactions with throughout the game. maybe they'll be like eji. someone who cares too much. is too passionate. 

eji struggles with mental battles but this represents a necessary turning point for him. 

this is alluded to, that something like this happens and reapers can be targets until the midway battle when a reaper assaults your mind. 

## boss fights
the inspiration for boss fights are like the waves of emotion. you hold it in until the breaking point. then it breaks and unleashes. similar to phases in a boss fight. in this game subsequent waves get a bit easier. 

it comes in waves. emotions. you have to pass thresh holds and then things come crashing down all over you. like activating the next phase in a boss fight. the stages of grief
denial -> acceptance 

# lore

## reaper origins
Reapers are those with regrets but have controlled their feelings.
when you become a reaper you forget the reason you feel the way you do. 
all you have left are your emotions but you don't remember why. 
eventually when your "responsibilities are absolved" so are your emotions and thus your regret.  
responsibilities being an allegory for passion or pupose in life. 
there's no more reason left to live. but are they being absolved? 
or is it just being left to others.

## love plant
There's a plant that you can only own one of. Try to own anymore and the old plant eventually withers away and dies. Many attempts have been made by owners to try and own more than one but eventually only one remains in the end. Life restoration plant.


# plot 
the missions play out relatively the same. it starts out with them just chatting at a coffee shop. discussing philosophy or whatever. they get texted their mission and then they're off. it's relatively hub based? it takes place in a big city so things are cramped. 
it's a spirit city though... so cars and people aren't there (so I don't have to draw them)

reaper explores the question how do you live a life without regrets... how do you [[minimize-regret]]
each day explores a different facet of that question

### mission 1
the first mission sees eji chasing something. running through an alleyway and get obscured by some buildings. camera pans up to the sky where sei is smoking. his smoke flows through the sky. r e a p e r appears over the moon. fades out.  fades back to eji. you fight some monsters. you fight a remixed monster that forces you to change your tactics. you fight a combination of both. you fight a boss that tests your understanding of the remix. but then there's a barrier. they're too resistent. that is when sei comes in and invades their mind. afterwords a small amount of exposition. the next day starts at the coffee shop where they chat until the target text comes in. and then they're off. 

### mission 2 - I should've done more with my life 
- regret doing the risky thing vs the not risky thing. I should've joined that startup and followed my dream. instead I worked for megaco and died a slave. 

sei: I remember that company... it never even took off. 
eji: It's not about whether it took off. It's about doing it. Knowing that you gave it your all..

like PT but instead of a traditional horror it's more of a surrealist existential horror. I'm going to do the same everything, everyday for the rest of my life until I die. is this what life is? you repeatedly go down the same hallway fighting the same enemies
go through their life. at the end is the boss.. the regret on their death bed. each time you go through the hallway you have to figure out how it's changed?

### mission 4
Eji isn’t allowed in the room during the discussion on what to do about a certain spirit. 
They go to execute the soft spirit. But he seems to be in control.

another antagonistic reaper is your physical partner when you eventually take down sei. 
she openly yearns for the day she can take down sei. 

### mission 7
the game ends with you taking down sei. sei's story is one of nihilism. you can do everything right. live a virtuous life. have the right amount of fun. find the perfect partner. but still leave life feeling like it wasn't enough. sei's mind wouldn't let him be happy. yet he still hoped. trying to rouse him positively is almost impossible. you have to appeal to his nihilism. this life. everything in it. wasn't worth it. nothing is. arms come from the ground. each one and arrow through his heart. and drags him into the ground until there's nothing.  

# concepts for enemies
enemies are manifestations of regret or strong feelings left behind before they died. 

someone who's killed themselves but stayed behind. they wanted to end it all but they felt strongly enough that they stayed behind. a life without 

# reaper artstyle
artstyle can be a mix like omori. pixel art 2d overworld. hand drawn battle system. look to manhwas for character design. I really like the girl from that one bdsm manga. I want to model the antagonistic shinigami after her. 

game takes place across a city that slowly opens up as it progresses and as it opens up it lets you revist areas you've already been to. similar to TWEWY. 

## in game assets 
- vending machine
- items

### environment
artificial recreations of nature is a theme I like
- aquarium
- green house
- plant shop 

## concept art pieces
- title 
- coffee shop hang out
- shops to buy items 
- vending machine screen (reflects you and sei)

## character art
reapers have a few common traits.
1. long trailing pieces of clothing
2. neck pieces to protect ya neck against other reapers

# random 
Sometimes you can’t. Sei's philosophy is you can’t. Accept your despair. Accept that nothing could have been done. Eji is you can try. Strive. Leave it to the next generation. Nihilism. eji is naive though. I’ll do what I want. Idealistic. Sei is practical. 

And you still live a life of regrets anyways.

(what was this conversation even about.. I forgot)
 eji - I mean it's not even about the fame at that point. like why even perform if only five dudes are going to listen. 
 sei - because those five dudes understand. and that's all that matters

# enemies
I always struggle with lore and designs for enemies. It has just never resonated that much to me. I'm always imagining the heroes in my mind but never the grunts that you face. It's rare that I even think too much about them actually. Omori enemies were a bit bland but had random moments of personality. Undertale enemies were good and memorable. I think I should strive for that. Screens should be a mix of story, a few forced enemies, maybe some minor exploration and puzzle solving.
