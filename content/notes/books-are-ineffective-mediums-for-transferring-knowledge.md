title: Books are ineffective Mediums for Transferring Knowledge
---

this is because they rely on "transmissionism" to convey information. author has knowledge. author writes that knowledge in a book. audience reads the book. audience gains the author's knowledge. this is obviously not how knowledge transfer works. 

> you have to actively engage in material to understand it. 
it ignores the way people understand and learn. 
1. emotions (the enthusiasm from a good professor, a fiction book conveying philosophy through tragic prose about human stories)
2. creative projects
3. active engagement
4. visuals
5. exploration (testing boundaries of ideas, disagreeing with it, synthesizing it, relating to other material, derive new ideas)
6. recall and spacing

exocortex has a somewhat organic way of training spacing and recall outside of SRS. if you are able to make a connection back to a topic that you haven't thought about in a while that's a form of recall and strengthing the connection. 


this means two things
1. having a better understanding of how you learn [[metacognition]]
2. there is room for exploring mediums that align with how humans understand 
   1. [[the-advantages-of-videogames-as-a-medium]] align with some of these learning models although videogames rarely convey information in this way because for the most part they are designed for entertainment first.
