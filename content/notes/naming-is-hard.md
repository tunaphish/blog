# feminism
Feminism has (sometimes intentional on both sides) misconceptions about the superiority of women over men. Quick google for the definition 
> the advocacy of women's rights on the basis of the equality of the sexes.

Equality being the key word which I think most people agree with. Issue for most people against feminism is the prospect that there is an inequality to begin with I suppose.
