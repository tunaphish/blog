title: Abundance Mentality and Growth Mentality
---

before getting this job at Amazon I didn't believe in myself. I didn't realize I didn't believe in myself either. I'm not sure how to explain it but I was somewhat resigned to certain tracts in life. I truly thought that some paths in life weren't available to me. Obviously I'm never going to be an NBA player but that doesn't mean I can't achieve what I want to achieve. 

# difference between abundance and growth
I see them both as opportunities existing but abundance is for external opportunities whereas growth is for internal opportunities. 

# accepting that you can do anything. but you won't do everything
I had this conversation with my friend. We truly believe we can do anything now... but we can't do everything. And that's okay. There's something scary but incredibly freeing about that. 
There's so much in this world you'll never do. You can never do. There's not enough time. Just thinking about what's most important to you and then choosing to do those things. 

For me that's hanging with the people I care about and working on the projects I find interesting. Getting a good night's sleep, a good workout and a good meal. That's all you need.
