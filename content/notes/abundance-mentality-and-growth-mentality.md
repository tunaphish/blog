title: Abundance Mentality and Growth Mentality
---

before getting this job at Amazon I didn't believe in myself. I didn't realize I didn't believe in myself either. I'm not sure how to explain it but I was somewhat resigned to certain tracts in life. I truly thought that some paths in life weren't available to me. Obviously I'm never going to be an NBA player but that doesn't mean I can't achieve what I want to achieve. 

## difference between abundance and growth
I see them both as opportunities existing but abundance is for external opportunities whereas growth is for internal opportunities.
