title: Sacrifice your Unique Vision for Impact
---

a leader has two qualities
- a strong idea of what the world ought to be like
- and the desire to make it so

having this vision and aligning others around you means you can achieves so much more than you could have as an individual. but eventually that hits a ceiling. your ability to align everyone under your singular vision reaches it's limit. I'm not sure where or how it happens but it does. 

after that you have a choice. you can trade your unique vision for a bigger impact. 

going up the management chain in a mega conglomerate means working with other leaders who each have a equally strong vision. aligning with others means you have clash, align and make common ground with other world views. 

 each individual voice is lost in a sea of others but there's some guiding vision. some shared worldview all pushing us in the same direction? enacting an enormous prescence on the world. that's what you get for sacrificing your unique voice. is it worth it? is it something to emulate for?

# software projects
the difficultly from writing large software projects isn't in writing lines of code. that's the easy part and anyone can do that. but it's from aligning a team's vision and mental models. if everyone could share the same mind and understand things exactly the same then development projects could infinitely scale up. however the exponential increase in  communication channels and linear increase in  conflicting mental models|world views means that you see a decrease in productivity as you add developers to a project. 

# as it applies to myself
solo game development vs finding a team. 

# auters
todo: people with such strength of vision, renaissance man who can directly control all aspects of a project that involes multiple people. think hideo kojima.
